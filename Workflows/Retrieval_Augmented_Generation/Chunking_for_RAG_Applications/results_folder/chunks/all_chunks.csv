# METHODS

## Subjects

Subjects 18 years of age or older were recruited by solicitations for volunteers with a ""fresh common cold."" Volunteers were screened by telephone for eligibility in a way designed to mask the criteria for enrollment in the study. These criteria included good health other than having the common cold; duration of symptoms of at least 48 hours but less than 96 hours; no active allergic rhinitis or other respiratory illness; no history of recurrent or chronic sinusitis or nasal polyps; no use of cough, cold, or analgesic drugs within 8 hours before enrollment; and reported nasal or head congestion at the time of the initial visit. After 28 subjects had been enrolled, the last criterion was eliminated to allow investigation of CT findings in subjects without congestion.","# METHODS

The subjects reported symptoms by entering information in a computer program with a rating scale from 0 (not present) to 10 (very severe). They used the scale to respond to questions about sneezing, runny nose, nasal stuffiness, sore throat, cough, fatigue or lethargy, muscle aches and pains, chills, feverishness, and headache. The subjects were also asked whether they had nasal or head congestion. Symptoms were assessed at the time of enrollment and daily between the hours of 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. for six days.","## Subjective Measurement of Illness

## Nasal-Airway Resistance

Nasal-airway resistance was measured by single-nostril active an-terior rhinomanometry.<sup>7</sup> Beginning with the left nostril, nasal air-flow and transnasal pressure at the contralateral nostril were meas-ured over the course of four consecutive breaths with the use of a commercial rhinomanometer (John Connell, Englewood, N.J.). During the measurement, pressure and flow signals were digitized at a sampling rate of 100 Hz and displayed on the computer moni-tor. The primary measure of nasal patency was the rate of flow (in liters per second) at a reference transnasal pressure of -1.5 cm of water during inspiration. A value under 0.6 liter per second for white subjects or under 0.7 liter per second for black subjects was considered abnormal.<sup>8</sup>","## Nasal-Airway Resistance

Nasal-airway resistance was measured by single-nostril active an-terior rhinomanometry.<sup>7</sup> Beginning with the left nostril, nasal air-flow and transnasal pressure at the contralateral nostril were meas-ured over the course of four consecutive breaths with the use of a commercial rhinomanometer (John Connell, Englewood, N.J.). During the measurement, pressure and flow signals were digitized at a sampling rate of 100 Hz and displayed on the computer moni-tor.

# Nasal Mucosal Transport

Nasal mucociliary clearance was determined by a modification of a previously described method.10-12 Fifteen microliters of a test solution was placed on the mucosa of each nostril in the anterior part of the nasal cavity below the inferior meatus. The test solution consisted of 8 mg of indigo carmine per milliliter, 3 mg of saccharin per milliliter, and 45 mg of sorbitol per milliliter (pH adjusted to 7.4). The subjects reported the first occurrence of a sweet taste, and then the pharyngeal cavity was examined for the appearance of the blue dye. Repeated inspections of the pharynx were made at 30-second intervals for 30 minutes or until dye was observed on each side. The combined clearance time was defined as the time elapsed from the introduction of the test solution to the first report of a sweet taste. Separate clearance times for the right and left nasal passages are not reported. For the combined clearance time, the occurrence of a sweet taste 20 minutes or more after the introduction of the solution was considered abnormal.

## CT Scans of the Upper Airway

CT scans of the nasal passages, ostiomeatal complex, and paranasal sinuses were obtained in 33 (30 percent) of the 110 subjects. Two subjects were excluded from the analysis because of bony changes in the maxillary antra, which were thought to be the result of chronic sinus disease. Twenty-eight subjects underwent CT scanning within 24 hours after enrollment, and three within 48 hours after enrollment. Subjects were selected for CT scanning primarily on the basis of scheduling considerations; the severity of illness was not a factor in selection. Fifteen to 20 images were obtained in a direct coronal plane that included the nasal passages and sinuses (GE-9800 Quick scanner, General Electric, Schenectady, N.Y., or Picker PQ-2000 scanner, Picker International, Cleveland). Fourteen subjects with abnormalities of the sinuses on the initial CT scans had repeat scans and repeat studies of nasal mucosal transport and airway resistance 8 to 15 days later. All scans were read independently by two radiologists who had no clinical information on the subjects; the radiologists compared their readings and resolved any differences in interpretation.","## CT Scans of the Upper Airway

Fourteen subjects with abnormalities on CT scan-ning underwent a follow-up evaluation after 13 to 20 days of illness (Fig. 1 and 2). Eleven of the 14 (79 percent) reported feeling well at the time of follow-up. The mucosal-transport time had returned to normal and sinus abnormalities had resolved or markedly im-proved in 11 of the subjects (79 percent).

## DISCUSSION

In a group of adults with naturally acquired common colds, we found a high prevalence of ostiomeatal and sinus abnormalities on CT scans. Although the high prevalence of sinus abnormalities was surprising, their reversal without antimicrobial treatment was not, since most colds are self-limited. These findings indicate that the common cold is actually a viral rhinosinusitis.","## DISCUSSION

## ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Each year, children suffer up to 5 colds and adults have two to three infections, leading to time off school or work, and considerable discomfort. Most symptoms resolve within 1 week, but coughs often persist for longer. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for common cold? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 21 systematic reviews and RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antihistamines, decongestants for short-term and for long-term relief, decongestants plus antihistamines, echinacea, steam inhalation, vitamin C, and zinc (intranasal gel or lozenges).","## ABSTRACT

# Key points

*   Transmission of common cold infections is mostly through hand-to-hand contact rather than droplet spread. Several types of virus can cause symptoms of colds.
    Each year, children suffer up to 5 colds and adults have two to three infections, leading to time off school or work and considerable discomfort. Most symptoms resolve within 1 week, but coughs often persist for longer.
*   Nasal and oral decongestants reduce nasal congestion over 3 to 10 hours, but we don't know how effective decongestants are for longer-term relief (>10 hours).
*   Antibiotics don't reduce symptoms overall, and can cause adverse effects and increase antibiotic resistance.
    Antibiotics may improve symptoms after 5 days compared with placebo in people with nasopharyngeal culture-positive Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it is difficult to identify which people may have these infections.
*   Vitamin C seems unlikely to reduce the duration or severity of cold symptoms compared with placebo.
    We don't know whether zinc gel or lozenges, echinacea, steam inhalation, or analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the duration of symptoms of colds.
*   Antihistamines may slightly reduce runny nose and sneezing, but their overall effect seems small. Some antihistamines may cause sedation or arrhythmias.
*   We found insufficient evidence to assess whether decongestants plus antihistamines are effective in reducing cold symptoms.","# Key points

**DEFINITION** Common colds are defined as upper respiratory tract infections that affect the predominantly nasal part of the respiratory mucosa. Because upper respiratory tract infections can affect any part of the mucosa, it is often arbitrary whether an upper respiratory tract infection is called a ""cold"" or ""sore throat"" (""pharyngitis"" or ""tonsillitis""), ""sinusitis"", ""acute otitis media"", or ""bronchitis"" (see figure 1 in review on sore throat). Sometimes all areas (simultaneously or at different times) are affected during one illness. Symptoms include sneezing, rhinorrhoea (runny nose), headache, and general malaise. In addition to nasal symptoms, half of sufferers experience sore throat, and 40% experience cough. [1] This review does not include treatments for people with acute sinusitis (see review on acute sinusitis), acute bronchitis (see review on acute bronchitis), or sore throat (see review on sore throat). One prospective US study (1246 children enrolled at birth) found that children who had frequent colds when aged 2 or 3 years were twice as likely to experience frequent colds at year 6 compared with children who had infrequent colds at 2 or 3 years (RR 2.8, 95% CI 2.1 to 3.9). [2]

**INCIDENCE/ PREVALENCE** Upper respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, throat complaints, and cough are responsible for 11% of general practice consultations in Australia. [3] Each year, children suffer about 5 such infections and adults two to three infections. [3] [4] [5] One cross-sectional study in Norwegian children aged 4 to 5 years found that 48% experienced more than two common colds annually. [6]

**AETIOLOGY/ RISK FACTORS** Transmission of common cold infection is mostly through hand-to-hand contact, with subsequent passage to the nostrils or eyes — rather than, as commonly perceived, through droplets in the air. [1] Common cold infections are mainly caused by viruses (typically rhinovirus, but also coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus, or metapneumovirus and others). For many colds, no infecting organism can be identified.

**PROGNOSIS** Common colds are usually short lived, lasting a few days, with a few lingering symptoms lasting longer, especially cough. Symptoms peak within 1 to 3 days and generally clear by 1 week, although cough often persists. [1] Although they cause no mortality or serious morbidity, common colds are responsible for considerable discomfort, lost work, and medical costs.

**AIMS OF INTERVENTION** To relieve symptoms, shorten the illness, or reduce complications; to reduce infectivity to others, with minimal adverse effects from treatments.

**OUTCOMES** Symptom severity: includes cure rate, time away from work or school, and symptom duration; occurrence of complications; adverse effects of treatment.

**METHODS** Clinical Evidence search and appraisal January 2010. The following databases were used to identify studies for this systematic review: Medline 1966 to January 2010, Embase 1980 to January 2010, and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2009, Issue 4 (1966 to date of issue). An additional search within The Cochrane Library was carried out for the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment (HTA). We also searched for retractions of studies included in the review. Abstracts of the studies retrieved from the initial search were assessed by an information specialist. Selected studies were then sent to the contributor for additional assessment, using predetermined criteria to identify relevant studies. Study design criteria for inclusion in this review were: published systematic reviews of RCTs and RCTs in any language, at least single blinded, and containing >20 individuals of whom >80% were followed up. We required 7 days of follow-up to include studies; however, we report outcomes within the studies at shorter timeframes than these. We excluded all studies described as ""open"", ""open label"", or not blinded unless blinding was impossible. We included systematic reviews of RCTs and RCTs where harms of an included intervention were studied applying the same study design criteria for inclusion as we did for benefits. In addition we use a regular surveillance protocol to capture harms alerts from organisations such as the US FDA and the UK MHRA, which are added to the reviews as required. Where possible, we have excluded RCTs undertaken solely in people with experimentally induced colds, although meta-analyses in some systematic reviews do include such RCTs. We have also excluded RCTs that only assessed the outcome of bacteriological clearance. We performed a broad search for RCTs of any decongestant, analgesic, or anti-inflammatory in people with common cold, and included any RCTs of sufficient quality. To aid readability of the numerical data in our reviews, we round many percentages to the nearest whole number. Readers should be aware of this when relating percentages to summary statistics such as relative risks (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs). We have performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions included in this review (see table, p 26). The categorisation of the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) reflects the quality of evidence available for our chosen outcomes in our defined populations of interest. These categorisations are not necessarily a reflection of the overall methodological quality of any individual study, because the Clinical Evidence population and outcome of choice may represent only a small subset of the total outcomes reported, and population included,","**DEFINITION** Common colds are defined as upper respiratory tract infections that affect the predominantly nasal part of the respiratory mucosa.

These categorisations are not necessarily a reflection of the overall methodological quality of any individual study, because the Clinical Evidence population and outcome of choice may represent only a small subset of the total outcomes reported, and population included,",5613,853,1,0.109849274,0.06929028,0.890402734,0.925246775,9a79f0cb-f1cc-40da-9fb1-28d2d516ff69,f5d0a638-c0ad-4ee7-a761-0ee6850d3959,results_folder/chunk_images/Common_cold_clinincal_evidence/page_1/text.3d835647-fbb6-4543-a584-33c56e77e472.png,2025-10-29T04:41:31.169803+00:00,0.18.3,dpt-2-20250919

## Further information on studies

[7] The effects of antihistamines were small. On a severity scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 or 4 (severe symptoms), antihistamines reduced the score from baseline by about 0.25 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.40; results presented graphically) for runny nose on days 1 and 2, 0.15 (95% CI 0 to 0.30) for sneezing on day 1, and 0.30 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.45) for sneezing on day 2.

[8] The RCTs identified by the second review assessed a wide variety of antihistamines, including cetirizine, chlorphenamine, clemastine, doxylamine succinate, loratadine, promethazine hydrochloride, and terfenadine. Decongestants used in combination with antihistamines included phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine.","## Further information on studies

Comment:
We found one further systematic review (search date 2007, 7 crossover RCTs, 113 people), which found that a single dose of phenylephrine significantly reduced nasal airway resistance compared with placebo at 30 to 90 minutes.

## Further information on studies

[8] This Cochrane review has been withdrawn as it is awaiting update. We will report the updated review in a future issue of this _Clinical Evidence_ review.

[8] In reviewing the evidence on decongestants plus antihistamines (including RCTs that had also included other additional treatments as part of the combination therapy), the review noted that in most trial reports there was insufficient data to judge the effect size and thus the clinical importance. The review concluded that decongestants plus antihistamines might lead to some general improvement and relief from a blocked or runny nose, although there is not enough evidence to be certain.","## Further information on studies

We found one systematic review (search date 2009) on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [16] The review included 6 RCTs comparing NSAIDs versus placebo and pooled data. However, three RCTs were in people with experimentally induced colds. We have not reported these RCTs further. Of the remaining three RCTs, one did not report on efficacy outcomes.

## Benefits and harms

### Echinacea versus placebo:

We found two systematic reviews (search dates 2007 [17] and 2006 [18]). The reviews had different inclusion criteria, performed a different analysis, and came to differing conclusions. The first review excluded combinations of echinacea with other herbs, included RCTs that reported on severity of symptoms or duration, and did not pool data because of clinical heterogeneity between included RCTs (preparation used, trial design, and outcomes reported). It included 14 RCTs on treatment. [17] The second review [18] included RCTs in which echinacea had been used with or without a supplement, all of which reported on cold duration. In the analysis of effects on cold duration, it included 4 RCTs that were included in the first review, two RCTs that were excluded by the first review because of methods used, and included one RCT not included in the first review. The second review pooled data and came to slightly different conclusions to the first review (see further information on studies).","## Benefits and harms

Further information on studies
[17] [18] The second review, which pooled data, also performed a sensitivity analysis of RCTs in which no supplement had been given with echinacea. [18] It found no significant difference between groups in cold duration (3 RCTs, 915 people; WMD -1.57 days, 95% CI -4.34 days to +1.19 days, P = 0.27). The authors of the first review [17] noted that the second review [18] had come to more favourable conclusions on the effects of echinacea than it had. The authors of the first review noted that the second review had included trials on highly variable echinacea products and pooled data, whereas they had chosen not to because of the clinical heterogeneity between trials.

Comment:
Echinacea is not a single product. There are >200 different preparations based on different plants, different parts of the plant (roots, herbs, whole plant), and different methods of extraction. The weakness of trial methods and differences in interventions make it difficult to draw conclusions about effectiveness. Large RCTs may be difficult because echinacea is not patentable, and each producer controls a small share of the market. The authors of the first systematic review [17] received personal information about several unpublished studies that they were not able to include.","Comment:

## Benefits and harms
### Zinc lozenges versus placebo:
We found three systematic reviews (search dates 1997, [22] 1998, [23] and 2003 [24]), which compared zinc lozenges (gluconate or acetate) versus placebo for the treatment of naturally acquired colds. The reviews had different inclusion and exclusion criteria. The first and second reviews performed a meta-analysis, [22] [23] whereas the third review was narrative in character, [24] and did not perform a meta-analysis. The third review [24] identified 10 RCTs that were included in the two other reviews [22] [23] (including all the RCTs identified by both earlier reviews and 1 RCT excluded by the first review owing to poor methods, and 2 RCTs excluded by the second review because they involved people with experimentally induced colds). In addition, the third review identified two RCTs carried out subsequent to the earlier reviews, the results from which we report separately. [24] We found one subsequent RCT. [25] We found one further systematic review, which did not report numerical results of statistical analyses, so we have not reported it further here (see comments). [26] One review identified case reports on adverse effects associated with zinc preparations (see further information on studies). [27]","## Benefits and harms

## Further information on studies

[32] The RCTs included in the analysis used a variety of therapeutic protocols, ranging from a single dose at the onset of cold symptoms to continued treatment for 4 days using differing regimens. The review noted that RCTs in which vitamin C was used as treatment in doses up to 4 g daily did not demonstrate any benefit, but one large RCT reported an ""equivocal"" benefit from the use of a very high 8-g therapeutic dose at the onset of symptoms. However, there were methodological issues in this large RCT in that one of the two placebo groups had substantial baseline differences with the vitamin C groups, and that comparisons were restricted to the placebo group that had similar baseline data to the other vitamin C arms. **Adverse effects** Seven RCTs included in the review provided data on adverse effects. In these RCTs, 2490 people took >1 g daily of vitamin C during prophylaxis compared with 2066 people taking placebo. The review stated that no serious symptoms were reported. It found that 5.8% of people taking vitamin C reported symptoms that they attributed to the medication, compared with 6.0% taking placebo (no further details reported).","## Further information on studies

We initially allocate 4 points to evidence from RCTs, and 2 points to evidence from observational studies. To attain the final GRADE score for a given comparison, points are deducted or added from this initial score based on preset criteria relating to the categories of quality, directness, consistency, and effect size. Quality: based on issues affecting methodological rigour (e.g., incomplete reporting of results, quasi- randomisation, sparse data [<200 people in the analysis]). Consistency: based on similarity of results across studies. Directness: based on generalisability of population or outcomes. Effect size: based on magnitude of effect as measured by statistics such as relative risk, odds ratio, or hazard ratio.","GRADE Evaluation of interventions for Common cold.

Echinacea is one of the most commonly used herbal products, but controversy exists about its benefit in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Thus, we did a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold. 14 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis. Incidence of the common cold was reported as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI, and duration of the common cold was reported as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Weighted averages and mean differences were calculated by a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird methodology). Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and review of L'Abbé plots, and publication bias was assessed through the Egger weighted regression statistic and visual inspection of funnel plots. Echinacea decreased the odds of developing the common cold by 58% (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.25–0.71; Q statistic p<0.001) and the duration of a cold by 1.4 days (WMD –1.44, –2.24 to –0.64; p=0.01). Similarly, significant reductions were maintained in subgroup analyses limited to Echinaguard/Echinacin use, concomitant supplement use, method of cold exposure, Jadad scores less than 3, or use of a fixed-effects model. Published evidence supports echinacea's benefit in decreasing the incidence and duration of the common cold.","Echinacea is one of the most commonly used herbal products, but controversy exists about its benefit in the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

# Introduction
According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the US population has 1 billion colds annually. Adults have between two and four colds per year, whereas children have between six and ten colds.¹ Although rhinovirus and coronavirus are the most common viruses precipitating cold symptoms, approximately 200 other viruses are also known to cause the common cold. In the USA, about 40% of lost work time and 30% of time lost from school are attributed to symptoms caused by the common cold.² The common cold is also associated with a large financial burden on society, with about US$1.5 billion spent annually for physicians' visits and another $2 billion spent on non-prescription cough and cold treatments.³","# Introduction

In 2002, approximately 20% of the adult US population used nutraceuticals (herbal products, functional foods, animal based supplements). Echinacea, a collection of nine related plant species indigenous to North America, was the most common nutraceutical used and was consumed by over 40.3% of these people. 4.5 Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea pallida, and Echinacea purpurea (figure 1) are the most common species recognised for their medicinal value. 6 The mechanism of action underlying the proposed immunostimulatory effects of echinacea remains unclear. Some evidence suggests that upregulation of tumour necrosis factor-a mRNA, which is stimulated by agonistic activity of the cannabinoid receptor (CB2) by alkamides present in echinacea, has a role. 7","In 2002, approximately 20% of the adult US population used nutraceuticals (herbal products, functional foods, animal based supplements).

## Meta-analyses outcomes
A summary of individual study data on the incidence and duration of colds is provided in table 2. Meta-analysis showed that echinacea decreased the odds of a patient contracting a cold by 58% (odds ratio [OR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.25–0.71; Q statistic p<0.001), corresponding with a risk difference of –0.17 (–0.25 to –0.08; number needed to treat 6). Echinacea was also found to decrease the duration of cold by 1.4 days (WMD –1.44, –2.24 to –0.64; p=0.01), as shown in figure 3 and figure 4. The Q statistic showed significant heterogeneity in both the incidence and duration analyses. However, review of the L'Abbé plot for incidence showed that included studies generally agreed on echinacea's positive effect, but not the magnitude of the benefit (figure 5). Some degree of asymmetry was noted upon review of the funnel plots for both the incidence and duration analyses, resulting in our inability to rule out the presence of publication bias in our analyses (figure 6). However, when publication bias was assessed using the Egger weighted regression statistic, no significant publication bias was detected for either the incidence or duration analyses (p=0.64 and p=0.79, respectively).","## Meta-analyses outcomes

Our meta-analysis had only one cold incidence study²⁸ that used echinacea with other supplements (vitamin C and propolis). This study found an 86% reduction in the incidence of the common cold. As such, we cannot determine if the combination of echinacea with other nutraceuticals yields better results than echinacea alone. Several experimental studies have shown that vitamin C might have effects on the immune system.³⁶ Propolis, a natural resinous product collected by honeybees from various plant sources, has also been used in the prevention of respiratory infections.³⁷ For cold duration as the outcome, four studies²⁰,²⁸⁻³⁰ used echinacea combined with additional supplements (vitamin C, propolis, lemongrass leaf, spearmint, peppermint, thyme, citric acid, rosemary leaf, eucalyptus, and fennel seed) and yielded a 1·3-day shorter duration of cold than placebo. Echinacea used alone, although showing a similar benefit, did not show a significantly shorter duration of cold than placebo (p=0·27), suggesting that this sub-group analysis was underpowered. Comparing the results on duration of cold in the overall analysis to the subgroup analyses suggests that the benefit is caused by echinacea rather than the other supplements.","Our meta-analysis had only one cold incidence study²⁸ that used echinacea with other supplements (vitamin C and propolis).

inoculation, the incidence was only reduced by 35%. One postulation for the possible reduced benefits with direct inoculation is that echinacea works better on preventing the common cold caused by viruses other than rhinovirus. With over 200 viruses capable of causing the common cold, echinacea could have modest effect against rhinovirus but marked effects against other viruses. Of the direct rhinovirus inoculation trials, the most touted is the study by Turner and colleagues¹⁴ published in 2005. The authors compared patients given E angustifolia equivalent to 900 mg/day with placebo and showed that echinacea did not have ""clinically significant effects on infection with a rhinovirus or on the clinical illness that results from it"". The German Commission E has approved E purpurea at a recommended dose of 900 mg but has not approved E angustifolia.⁸ The 1999 WHO monograph recommends E angustifolia at a dose of 3 g, a dose more than three times the dose used by Turner and colleagues.³⁸ As such, the dose used in this trial may have been too low to be fully effective.","inoculation, the incidence was only reduced by 35%.

The previous meta-analysis done by Melchart and colleagues and updated in November, 2005,39 included 16 trials encompassing 22 analyses and showed a benefit of echinacea for the treatment but not prevention of a common cold.13,39 By comparison, our meta-analysis included 14 trials encompassing 16 analyses. Although our results are in agreement with the previous meta-analysis, our results suggest an additional benefit of echinacea for use in the prevention, as well as the treatment, of a cold. The meta-analysis by Linde and colleagues39 assessed a cold severity endpoint, included two unpublished evaluations, and excluded studies that used experimental rhinovirus inoculation or that combined echinacea with other nutraceutical ingredients. In our analysis we chose not to evaluate cold severity because of concerns about the potential heterogeneity of the methods used for cold severity assessment in the studies. We included studies evaluating echinacea with other nutraceuticals in our analysis, as well as studies evaluating direct rhinovirus inoculation, which have the highest internal validity since the virus, the degree of exposure, and the exact time of exposure are all known. We decided to address the effect of these potential confounders through the use of subgroup and sensitivity analyses rather than through exclusion, which provides more information from which to make a determination of the efficacy of echinacea. Furthermore, we included one study that was published after Melchart and colleagues updated their analysis39 and excluded unpublished studies because data in such studies have not undergone rigorous peer review.","The previous meta-analysis done by Melchart and colleagues and updated in November, 2005,39 included 16 trials encompassing 22 analyses and showed a benefit of echinacea for the treatment but not prevention of a common cold.13,39 By comparison, our meta-analysis included 14 trials encompassing 16 analyses.

potential confounder in our analyses, it should be noted that if these agents do in fact have beneficial properties that reduce the incidence and/or duration of the common cold, then this would result in an underestimation of echinacea's benefit. Second, although the Egger statistic shows absence of publication bias, our funnel plot shows asymmetry, suggesting that the potential for publication bias cannot be eliminated. Publication bias arises when trials with negative outcomes have a lower propensity to be published. Third, heterogeneity was present in our meta-analysis; however, the L'Abbé plot shows that the heterogeneity is a result of studies' disagreement in the magnitude, but not the direction, of echinacea's benefit. Furthermore, after doing various subgroup analyses to assess the effect of clinical heterogeneity, echinacea maintained significant effects on the reduction of cold incidence and duration. Finally, this analysis focuses on the efficacy but not the safety of echinacea. Although adverse events with echinacea are not commonly reported, gastrointestinal upset and rash have been reported. Much more work needs to be done to elucidate the safety of prolonged therapy since its effect on the rate-corrected QT interval, blood pressure, and other safety parameters is not well known. Of note, echinacea is a human cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme inhibitor so the potential for drug interactions also needs to be assessed. 41","potential confounder in our analyses, it should be noted that if these agents do in fact have beneficial properties that reduce the incidence and/or duration of the common cold, then this would result in an underestimation of echinacea's benefit.

## Conclusion
An analysis of the current evidence in the literature suggests that echinacea has a benefit in decreasing the incidence and duration of the common cold; however, large-scale randomised prospective studies controlling for variables such as species, quality of preparation and dose of echinacea, method of cold induction, and objectivity of study endpoints evaluated are needed before echinacea for the prevention or treatment of the common cold can become standard practice.","## Conclusion

The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral infection of the upper respiratory tract involving the nose, sinuses, pharynx and larynx. The virus is spread by hand contact with secretions from an infected person (direct or indirect) or aerosol of the secretions and virus.¹ The incubation period varies but is just under two days for rhinovirus.² Symptoms, which generally relate to the infected mucosa, typically peak at 1–3 days and last 7–10 days, although they occasionally persist for three weeks.¹,³⁻⁵ They include sore throat, rhinitis, rhinorrhea, cough and malaise.¹,⁴ The severity and type of symptoms will vary among individuals and with different infective agents. For example, fever is common in children but rare and mild in adults.¹ The incidence of the common cold declines with age.⁵⁻⁷ Children under two years have about six infections a year, adults two to three and older people about one per year.⁵⁻⁹ Stress¹⁰ and poor sleep¹¹ may increase the risk of the common cold among adults, whereas attendance at a daycare centre¹² increases the risk among preschool children.","The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral infection of the upper respiratory tract involving the nose, sinuses, pharynx and larynx.

## KEY POINTS
* Evidence for interventions aimed at preventing and treating the common cold is frequently of poor quality, and results are inconsistent.
* The best evidence for the prevention of the common cold supports physical interventions (e.g., handwashing) and possibly the use of zinc supplements.
* The best evidence for traditional treatments supports the use of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for pain and fever) and possibly antihistamine-decongestant combinations and intranasal ipratropium. Ibuprofen appears to be superior to acetaminophen for the treatment of fever in children.
* The best evidence for nontraditional treatments of the common cold supports the use of oral zinc supplements in adults and honey at bedtime for cough in children over one year.","## KEY POINTS

We review the evidence underpinning preven-
tive and treatment interventions for the common
cold. We do not explore the proposed biologic
mechanisms for the different products, because
most are not substantiated and generally represent
more supposition than science. The quality of the
evidence was frequently poor, with a moderate to
high risk of bias. Although preventive interventions
have somewhat discrete outcomes (presence of an
upper respiratory tract infection), interpretation of
the evidence for treatment of the common cold is
challenged by the complexity of outcome
reporting. The evidence used in this review is

How can the common cold
be distinguished from other
conditions?

The symptoms and signs of the common cold
overlap with those of other conditions. Allergic
rhinitis presents similarly, but it may have a sea-
sonal component or clear allergic aggravation
and is unlikely to have an accompanying sore
throat. When sore throat is the primary com-
plaint, streptococcal pharyngitis should be con-
sidered. Centor criteria20 are helpful in delineat-
ing the need for throat swabs and antibiotics.","How can the common cold

**Physical interventions**
A Cochrane systematic review examined the effectiveness of traditional physical public health interventions in preventing upper respiratory tract infections in 67 studies of various types (randomized controlled trials [RCTs], cluster RCTs, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, case-control studies and before-after studies).30 The type of interventions varied considerably — handwashing, use of alcohol-based disinfectants, other disinfectants, hand-wipes, gloves, masks, gowns and various combinations. As a result, pooling of data was limited, and many of the studies had an unclear or high risk of bias.

Probiotics may be helpful in preventing upper respiratory tract infections, but the interventions and evidence are inconsistent. A systematic review of 14 RCTs included 10 trials (n = 3451) that provided sufficient data for pooling.34 Pediatric and adult populations from a wide variety of countries were included. Probiotic prophylaxis reduced the number of participants who had one or more upper respiratory tract infections (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36 to 0.92) and the number of upper respiratory tract infections per person-year (rate ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). Both outcomes had inconsistent results in the individual studies, reflected in estimates of heterogeneity (P = 69% and 44%, respectively).","# Probiotics

Antihistamines, combination therapy
Antihistamines combined with decongestants, analgesics or both appear to have a small to moderate effect on the common cold in older children and adults. A large systematic review and meta-analysis⁵³ found that the antihistamine–decongestant combination reduced global symptoms in six pooled studies (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.50). The estimated number needed to treat was five. Although overall adverse events were not increased, there were significant increases in dry mouth (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.75 to 8.14) and insomnia (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.08 to 8.47).

# Over-the-counter cough suppressants

Over-the-counter cough suppressants are of no benefit for children, and Health Canada recommends against their use in children under the age of six years.67 For adults, the benefit is unclear but likely small. A systematic review59 evaluated a variety of outcomes such as cough and global improvement scores in children (age two to seven years), but statistically significant improvements were infrequent and inconsistent and of doubtful clinical significance.59,68 In addition, a Canadian review of codeine for acute cough in children found no benefit when compared with placebo. In adults, antihistamines and codeine had no effect on cough.59 One study of guaifenesin found no benefit; in another, 75% of participants reported that guaifenesin was helpful for their cough, compared with 31% given placebo (p < 0.01).59 Dextromethorphan had mixed results, with two positive trials showing a 12%-36% improvement in cough scores (p < 0.05).59 Combination products seemed to have some benefit, but there is little consistency in outcomes and it is not clear whether all negative outcomes were reported. Poor trial quality, varying reported outcomes and inconsistent results limit interpretation.59","# Over-the-counter cough suppressants

Vapour rub
Vapour rub containing camphor, menthol and eucalyptus oil is applied to the neck and chest. In the one RCT60 we found that assessed its efficacy, harms appeared to outweigh benefits. No effect was found on rhinorrhea. Scores for cough frequency and severity were improved compared with no treatment (p = 0.006 or better) but not compared with petrolatum (placebo). Scores for child and parental sleep were both significantly improved with vapour rub versus petrolatum (p = 0.008 or better). For the combination of all scales (range 6–42), vapour rub had an improved score of about 4 higher than petrolatum (p = 0.03).

Much more evidence now exists in this area,
but many uncertainties remain regarding inter-
ventions to prevent and treat the common cold.
We focused on RCTs and systematic reviews and
meta-analyses of RCTs for therapy, but few of
the studies had a low risk of bias. However,
many of the results were inconsistent and had
small effects (e.g., vitamin C), which arouses
suspicion that any noted benefit may represent
bias rather than a true effect.82 We encourage
researchers to perform well-designed RCTs on
promising treatments or on preventive methods
with limited evidence (i.e., gargling or garlic).
Further work to help clinicians clearly distin-
guish the common cold from other upper respira-
tory tract infections would also be useful.","Much more evidence now exists in this area,

## Abstract
Respiratory viral infections, also known as the common cold, are the most common infections in humans. Despite their benign nature, they are a major cause of morbidity and mortality on a worldwide basis. Several viruses have been associated with such illness, of which rhinovirus is the most common. Symptom production is a combination of viral cytopathic effect and the activation of inflammatory pathways. Therefore, antiviral treatment alone may not be able to prevent these events. The optimal use of such agents also requires earlier initiation; therefore, it is important to develop accurate and rapid diagnostic techniques for respiratory viruses. Before any reliable and effective treatment is available, symptomatic therapies may remain the only possible choice of management.

# 1. Introduction
The common cold is the most commonly encountered infectious syndrome of human beings. Most observers consider colds to include symptoms of rhinitis with variable degrees of pharyngitis, but the major associated symptoms include nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough and hoarse voice. Patients frequently report chills, but significant high temperature is unusual. Colds are usually self-limiting to previously healthy individuals, but there are also recognised complications such as secondary bacterial infections, exacerbations of asthma [1], chronic obstructive airways disease [2] and cystic fibrosis [3-5]. Despite the benign nature of the illness in the majority of cases, it is still a significant economic burden on society. It leads to an increase in consultations with clinicians, increased absence from school and work and subsequently causes loss of earnings.","# 1. Introduction

virus (RSV) are spread by direct hand contact with contaminated skin and environmental surfaces. This is followed by self-inoculation of virus into the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva [6]. Airborne transmission of rhinovirus is also possible, but this depends on the duration of exposure to infected individuals [7]. Transmission of parainfluenza virus (PIV) is by direct person-to-person contact or by large particle aerosol spread. The high rate of infection in childhood, coupled with the frequency of reinfection, suggests that they spread from person to person. There is evidence to suggest that the infectious dose of PIV is small, as two-thirds of volunteers developed flu-like symptoms following low-titre PIV intranasal challenge [8]. RSV is spread by infected respiratory secretions. The major route of transmission appears to be by large particle aerosol or direct contact with self-inoculation. Spread requires either close contact with the infected individual or contamination of the hands followed by introduction into conjunctiva. Influenza tends to spread by small-particle aerosols [9]. The relative efficacy of the various transmission routes under natural conditions for each virus is unknown.","virus (RSV) are spread by direct hand contact with contaminated skin and environmental surfaces.

Parainfluenza virus is the most common cause of croup (acute laryngotracheobronchitis) in young children and accounts for 5% of all causes of the common cold. The human parainfluenza viruses are categorised into types 1–4, on the basis of antigenic differences. They are transmitted from person to person by direct contact with infectious respiratory secretions or by large-particle aerosols. The incubation period is about 3–6 days. Bone marrow transplant recipients, children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, prematurity, congenital heart disease or asthma are prone to develop lower respiratory infection and require additional oxygen supplementation [15,16]. One-third of children with lower respiratory infection due to parainfluenza are thought to develop secondary bacterial infections [17].","Parainfluenza virus is the most common cause of croup (acute laryngotracheobronchitis) in young children and accounts for 5% of all causes of the common cold.

Coronavirus accounts for 7–26% of all upper respiratory tract infections in adults [18–20]. An important feature of coronavirus infection is the short-lived immunity, resulting in a high reinfection rate [21]. The mode of transmission of coronavirus is most likely due to aerosol inhalation. However, it does not grow well at all in cell culture, and therefore, its virology is not fully appreciated. Recently, a novel coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has been proposed as the cause for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [22]. The virus induces symptoms of atypical pneumonia, clinically indistinguishable from similar syndromes. The severity is such that a 15% mortality rate has been reported. No treatment has yet been identified as reliably successful. Transmission is by droplet spread, requiring close contact.

Influenza virus infection accounts for 5–15% of common colds. Small-particle aerosol spread has been implicated in several outbreaks [24], and it can retain its infectivity for prolonged periods after aerosolisation in conditions under low humidity [25]. There are two features that distinct influenza from other respiratory viruses. First, influenza viruses are able to produce new strains for which most of the population lack immunity, leading to worldwide outbreaks. The unique feature of antigenic variation is referred to as antigenic shift or drift. Second, a recent outbreak in humans of the lethal H5N1 influenza subtype suggested that direct transmission between humans and infected birds without an intermediate host is possible [26]. This avian influenza subtype caused high mortality, killing 70–100% of chicken and also 6 humans [27]. There was also a high proportion of amino acid changes in all gene products within H5N1 influenza virus except the surface genes [28]; this provides further support for antigenic drift.","Influenza virus infection accounts for 5–15% of common colds.

A new pneumovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV),
has recently been isolated in the Netherlands [34]. It is
closely related taxonomically to RSV [34]. This virus
possibly accounts for about 10% of unexplained respiratory
infections in children during the winter season. Seropreva-
lence studies show that the virus has been circulating in
humans for at least 50 years, that 25% of children by age 1
year have antibodies to the virus and that by age 5 years
virtually all are seropositive [34]. Analysis of the amplified
sequences showed two clusters of HMPV [35]. The clinical
manifestation of HMPV can vary from mild upper respira-
tory symptoms to severe infections requiring hospital admis-
sions. This clinical picture is indistinguishable form that of
other respiratory viruses. Coinfection of HMPV with other
respiratory viruses is uncommon [36], and its role in human
respiratory infections is still poorly understood. This new
pathogen will certainly warrant long-term surveillance.","A new pneumovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV),

Rhinovirus, the most important cold virus, accounting for 80% of all upper respiratory illnesses during autumn [37], commonly invades the upper respiratory tract with minimal nasal epithelial damage [38], whereas influenza mainly causes extensive damage to the lower airways [9]. Due to the prevalence of rhinovirus, most of the studies of common colds are based on this virus. The initial deposition of rhinovirus in the eyes and nose leads to attachment of the virus to host cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptors at the back of the throat. Once inside the nasal epithelial cell, there is no significant increase in the number of inflammatory cells [39], but increases in neutrophils have been detected in nasal mucosa and secretions [40]. This may reflect the release of a cascade of inflammatory cytokines such as kinins, leukotrienes, histamines, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 interleukin-8, tumour necrosis factor and RANTES (regulated by activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) [41,42], which are partly responsible for the symptoms [43]. Levels of kinins, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in nasal secretions have also been shown to correlate with the severity and duration of symptoms [42,44,45].","Rhinovirus, the most important cold virus, accounting for 80% of all upper respiratory illnesses during autumn [37], commonly invades the upper respiratory tract with minimal nasal epithelial damage [38], whereas influenza mainly causes extensive damage to the lower airways [9].

There are two distinct groups of coronaviruses that infect humans: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. They are distinct from each other by the structural proteins as demonstrated by immunoelectrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunoab- sorbant assay (ELISA), despite being similar in charges and molecular weights [46,47]. HCoV-229E utilises human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) as a receptor to gain entry into the respiratory epithelium. hAPN is a 150-kDa zinc-binding protein with endopeptidase activity. In experimental studies, when human cell cultures are pretreated with monoclonal antibodies against hAPN, viral infection appears blocked [48]. However, HCoV-OC43 gains entry into the respiratory epithelium by using the two surface glycoproteins, Haemag- glutinin-esterase (HE) and Spike (S) glycoproteins [49]. Despite their differences in pathogenesis, they both cause similar clinical manifestations [50]. Reinfection of corona- virus is common, though the underlying reason is not clearly defined. It may be due to infection with closely related but different strains [51] or to a reduction in immunity over time [21]. Volunteers who are seropositive to coronavirus prior to intranasal challenge are not completely protected from symptom development [52].","There are two distinct groups of coronaviruses that infect humans: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.

Influenza virus replicates throughout the respiratory tract, and it is recoverable from the upper and lower airways. However, it tends to cause more significant damage in the lower respiratory tract [53,54]. Acute diffuse inflammation of the larynx, trachea and bronchi has been demonstrated during bronchoscopy of people with uncomplicated influenza infection [55]. Both the innate and cellular immune responses are heightened during infection. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-α (IFN-α) are induced and are released from infected cells. They reach their peak levels 2 days following infection, which coincides with the most severe clinical symptom score, mucous production, fever and viral load [56].

RSV replicates primarily in the superficial layer of the respiratory epithelium [58], and it spreads from the upper to lower airways by aspiration of secretions via the respiratory epithelium. RSV infection causes significant damage to the epithelium and, more importantly, to the mucociliary escalator [59]. This inhibits the removal of mucous and cell debris, leading to occlusion of small bronchioles. Interferon plays a pivotal role in inhibiting viral replication, and RSV infection is notable for lack of local interferon production [60]. RSV induces the production of IL-5 and interferon-gamma.

## 2.1. Diagnosis

The diagnosis of common colds is usually based on the patient's clinical presentation and the clinician's assessment of the disease. Sometimes, the diagnosis can be less straight-forward for three reasons. First, clinical features of a common cold may overlap with those of pharyngitis and bronchitis, which are related syndromes of shared viral origins. To complicate matters, pharyngitis and sinusitis can also be caused by bacterial infections. Second, allergic diseases of the upper airway often have clinical features resembling those of common colds. Third, infants and young children are not able to express their symptoms, and clinicians have the challenge to distinguish between benign viral infections and severe invasive bacterial infections.","## 2.1.

Another important factor in respiratory viral diagnosis is to submit an appropriate sample for testing. Inadequate or improper specimen collection and transport account for the largest source of error in the accuracy of viral detection results [64]. Nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal wash specimens are generally considered to be the specimens of choice for the detection of respiratory viruses [65-67]. Obtaining an aspirate is unpleasant and requires the use of a suction device by a trained individual, which makes it unattractive in widespread clinical application. In contrast, the collection of a nasal swab is simple, painless and quick, and it does not require special equipment and skilled personnel. A recent prospective study showed that the sensitivity of nasal swabs was comparable to nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of all major respiratory viruses by tissue culture with the exception of RSV [68].","Another important factor in respiratory viral diagnosis is to submit an appropriate sample for testing.

2.2. Tissue culture

Isolation of viruses in tissue culture is the gold standard of virus detection. The processing of clinical specimens often starts with the addition of antibiotics and antifungals prior to inoculation into the appropriate cell lines. They are usually incubated at 33 °C and are observed daily for virus-induced effect (cytopathic effect, CPE). The three major tissue cell lines commonly used to isolate and identify respiratory viruses are primarily monkey kidney (sensitive to PIV and influenza), human fetal lung fibroblasts (sensitive to adenovirus and rhinovirus) and a continuous cell line, such as HEP-2 cells (sensitive to adenovirus and RSV) [69].

However, the slowness of tissue culture in viral detection makes it clinically impractical, especially when rapid diagnosis is required in order to initiate the appropriate therapy. Since there are more than 100 serotypes of rhinovirus [70], accurate diagnosis by such a method also becomes impossible and unreliable.","2.2. Tissue culture

The major advantage of antigen detection in respiratory secretions by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) is that they can be performed rapidly and can provide results within 24 h of receiving the specimen in the laboratory. IFA can be divided into direct and indirect methods. Direct immunofluorescence utilises a fluorochrome-labelled antibody that is specific to viral proteins or antigens.

chrome can be induced, which in turn can be detected by a fluorescence microscope. Indirect immunofluoroscence uses an unlabelled monoclonal antibody that binds to the viral antigen. It is then washed away, and any bound monoclonal antibody is detected with a labelled anti-mouse antibody. The use of multiple antibodies can, in theory, improve the sensitivity of the detection because multiple conjugate molecules can attach to virus-specific antibodies. ELISA is very similar to IFA; however, instead of using a fluorescent label, an enzyme label is used. This assay utilises a double antibody sandwich. A 'capture' antibody specific for the viral antigen being sought is bound to a reaction surface. When the specimen or viral antigen is added, it binds to the capture antibody. Bound antigen is detected by a second antiviral antibody, the 'detector' antibody. This detector antibody carries an enzyme label and, once bound, this enzyme produces a colour change. This colour change can be detected by photometry. The disadvantages of ELISA are that it is usually less sensitive and the reagents are only available for a limited number of viruses. In addition, adults tend to have lower viral titres in nasopharyngeal aspirates, making the sensitivity of this test understandably lower.","chrome can be induced, which in turn can be detected by a fluorescence microscope.

serum specimens 4 weeks apart are required for the diag-nosis of current or recent viral infections. Demonstration of a seroconversion from a negative to a positive IgG antibody response or detection of the presence of virus-specific IgM can be diagnostic of primary viral infection.

In addition, the result of serological tests for viral-specific antibodies must be interpreted with care for a number of reasons.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has dramatically altered the detection and characterisation of viral nucleic acids. It can identify target organisms from specimens with low concentrations of nuclear material in a matter of a few hours. For DNA viruses, PCR amplification is straightforward; the principle is demonstrated in Fig. 1. However, for RNA viruses, the genome is too unstable to be used in PCR, and RNA has to be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase, a retroviral enzyme that makes a precise copy of the mRNA. PCR is then performed in the normal manner to amplify genomic material. Once DNA has been amplified, it can be detected on the basis of size by gel electrophoresis or by Southern blotting, where the resolved nucleic acids are transferred to a membrane and react with nucleic acid probes specific for the desired PCR product.","Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has dramatically altered the detection and characterisation of viral nucleic acids.

Newer techniques in virus identification are nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), as shown in Fig. 2. It is an isothermic nucleic acid amplification method that amplifies RNA in a manner analogous to the amplification of DNA by PCR [71,72]. The NASBA reaction mixture contains oligonucleotide primers and three enzymes: avian myelobastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT), RN-ase H and T7 RNA polymerase for target-specific amplifi-cation [73]. The process takes place at 41 °C and results in exponential amplification of products within 2 h, producing single-stranded RNA of opposite sense to the original target. Detection of NASBA products can be reported by using a probe-capture hybridisation and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) [71]. More recently, 'real-time' detection using molecular beacons has been described [74].","Newer techniques in virus identification are nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), as shown in Fig. 2.

An advantage of the NASBA assay compared with PCR methods [76,77] is the continuous isothermic process that does not require a thermocycler. A constant temperature throughout the amplification reaction enables each step of the reaction to amplify the targeted RNA or DNA exponentially. Thus, the NASBA reaction is more efficient than PCR methods that are restricted to binary increases per cycle [76,77].","An advantage of the NASBA assay compared with PCR methods [76,77] is the continuous isothermic process that does not require a thermocycler.

Influenza vaccines are the only commercially available vaccines. They are virtually all split products or purified subunit vaccines being used around the world. The strains (either A or B) that are used in immunisation are selected yearly, based on the recommendation by the World Health Organisation in conjunction with national public health institutions. Recent vaccines contain antigens of two influenza A subtypes, strains of the currently circulating H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes and one influenza B virus. The waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time requires annual re-immunisation, even if the vaccine antigens are unchanged. The current recommendation for influenza vaccination in the UK is to offer it to those over the age of 65, those with chronic heart, respiratory or renal disease and those who are diabetic or immunosuppressed. The national policy also states that those living in long-stay residential and nursing homes should be prioritised for vaccination. Despite the wide availability of the vaccine against influenza A, it still causes 13,000-20,000 excess deaths per year in the UK [78].","Influenza vaccines are the only commercially available vaccines.

Rhinovirus has more than 100 serotypes; it is unlikely that a unifying vaccine will be developed. However, the use of antivirals as chemoprophylaxis may have practical value. Topical application of interferon in the nose has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of colds in people who are exposed to others with a fresh cold [79]. This strategy reduced the overall risk of cold by 40% and almost eliminated proven rhinovirus colds in contacts.","Rhinovirus has more than 100 serotypes; it is unlikely that a unifying vaccine will be developed.

The development of an RSV vaccine has been hampered by the experience with formalin-inactivated whole RSV vaccine in the 1960s, as it caused 80% of RSV vaccinees to become hospitalised compared with 5% of controls, as well as two fatalities [80]. Current major research has focused on a prophylaxis using a humanised mouse monoclonal antibody, Palizivumab, which has been shown to reduce the rate of RSV-associated hospitalisation in premature infants [81].

Zinc has been shown to possess antiviral properties in vitro, and different preparations of zinc have been proposed for the treatment of the common cold. Zinc lozenges appeared to have positive effects on adults, but negative effects on children in terms of duration and severity of common cold symptoms [85,86].

Zanamivir has a poor oral bioavailability, and intranasal application has been shown to be effective in treating experimental influenza infection with a reduction in symptoms caused, virus shedding and the development of otitis media [97].",755,118,8,0.079308525,0.267470092,0.493735731,0.46318993,6058662e-df25-4890-a748-50647c8fa84e,b6996a56-e347-4165-afe9-627440cac9c5,results_folder/chunk_images/The_common_cold_a_review_of_the_literature/page_8/text.511baae8-93e7-4334-8b82-c4cfa4cff42b.png,2025-10-29T04:41:31.169851+00:00,0.18.3,dpt-2-20250919

Ribavarin, a synthetic guanosine nucleoside that has a broad spectrum of antiviral activity, has been approved for the treatment of RSV-related respiratory infection in children since 1986. It is the only approved therapy for lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV [98]. Potential benefits of ribavarin therapy include the inhibition of RSV-specific IgE production in nasal secretions, which has been associated with the development of hypoxaemia and wheezing [99], and improved pulmonary function [100]. Controlled studies also show that the use of ribavarin is effective in reducing the clinical severity score, duration of mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen use and days of hospitalisation [101].","Ribavarin, a synthetic guanosine nucleoside that has a broad spectrum of antiviral activity, has been approved for the treatment of RSV-related respiratory infection in children since 1986.

Although rhinovirus is the major cause of colds, its vast amount of serotypes has made development of antivirals against it problematic. Some 90% of rhinovirus serotypes gain entry into epithelial cells using ICAM-1 cellular receptors. Blockade of these receptors in experimental studies showed reduced infection severity [102], but further study is required before this treatment option becomes widely available.","Although rhinovirus is the major cause of colds, its vast amount of serotypes has made development of antivirals against it problematic.

The common cold and influenza (flu) are the most common syndromes of infection in human beings. These diseases are diagnosed on symptomatology, and treatments are mainly symptomatic, yet our understanding of the mechanisms that generate the familiar symptoms is poor compared with the amount of knowledge available on the molecular biology of the viruses involved. New knowledge of the effects of cytokines in human beings now helps to explain some of the symptoms of colds and flu that were previously in the realm of folklore rather than medicine— eg, fever, anorexia, malaise, chilliness, headache, and muscle aches and pains. The mechanisms of symptoms of sore throat, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal congestion, cough, watery eyes, and sinus pain are discussed, since these mechanisms are not dealt with in any detail in standard medical textbooks.","Ron Eccles

# Introduction
Acute upper respiratory tract viral infections (URTIs) are the most common diseases of human beings, with adults having two to five common colds each year and school children having from seven to ten colds per year.¹ The symptoms of URTIs are so common that self-diagnosis of common cold or influenza (flu) is normal among the general public and clinical diagnosis is usually the only diagnosis used by the physician. Over 200 serologically different viral types are responsible for human URTIs, with the rhinoviruses being the most common cause.¹ There is a large amount of information available about the molecular biology of the viruses associated with URTIs but relatively little information on the origins of the symptoms associated with them. An understanding of the pathophysiology of symptoms of URTIs is important, as most treatments for URTIs are symptomatic and clinical trials on the efficacy of new treatments usually focus on changes in symptom scores as the main parameter of efficacy rather than changes in viral titres in the airway or viral shedding. Clinical trials on any new antiviral treatment for URTIs aimed at the general population will need to demonstrate changes in symptom severity or duration of symptoms, since these parameters are the key benefits for most patients. Differences in clinical presentation are not so useful in identifying the causative agent of an URTI but there has been increasing interest in improving the accuracy of symptomatic diagnosis of emerging viral infections such as pandemic influenza² and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)³ because early diagnosis is essential for any antiviral therapy and for the initiation of public-health measures in the community (eg, isolation of infected cases). Here, I discuss the mechanisms that generate symptoms associated with URTIs, especially common cold and flu, but will not review virology in any detail except as regards relevance to symptoms.","# Introduction

The common cold syndrome has been defined in terms of experimental colds as a short mild illness with early symptoms of headache, sneezing, chilliness, and sore throat and later symptoms of nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough, and malaise. Generally the severity of symptoms increases rapidly, peaking 2–3 days after infection, with a mean duration of symptoms of 7–10 days but with some symptoms persisting for more than 3 weeks. Experimental colds in the adult are rarely associated with fever, and some subjects have a transient depression of oral temperature during the early phases of a cold. Studies on the symptoms generated by different common cold viruses indicate that it is not possible to identify the virus on the basis of the symptoms, since similar symptoms are caused by different viruses.","The common cold syndrome has been defined in terms of experimental colds as a short mild illness with early symptoms of headache, sneezing, chilliness, and sore throat and later symptoms of nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough, and malaise.

# Symptomatology
The symptoms of URTIs are triggered in response to the viral infection of the upper airway and the immune response to infection may be the main factor in generating the symptoms, rather than damage to the airway.9,10 Histological surveys of the nasal epithelium during experimental rhinovirus infections have not been able to find any morphological changes in the nasal epithelium of infected volunteers, apart from a substantial increase in polymorphonuclear leucocytes early in the course of the infection.11 The major cell monitoring the host for the invasion of pathogens is the macrophage, which has the ability to trigger an acute phase response when stimulated with components of viruses or bacteria—eg, viral RNA and bacterial cell wall components.12 The surface of the macrophage exhibits toll-like receptors that combine with the components of viral and bacterial pathogens and trigger the production of cytokines.12 The cytokines act to recruit other immune cells, trigger inflammation, and generate systemic symptoms such as fever.13 A complex mix of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators generates the symptoms of URTIs.14 The inflammatory mediator bradykinin is believed to have a major role in generating the local symptoms of URTIs (eg, sore throat and nasal congestion),15,16 and cytokines are believed to be responsible for the systemic symptoms (eg, fever).17 A discussion of the mechanisms that generate the URTI symptoms is the main topic of this review and each symptom will be discussed in turn.","# Symptomatology

# Sore throat
A scratchy sensation of throat irritation is often the first symptom of an URTI. This symptom may be related to early viral infection of the nasopharynx rather than the nasal epithelium.18 Point inoculation of rhinovirus on the inferior turbinate caused early infection of the nasopharynx with subsequent spread of infection anteriorly into the nose.18 The sensation of throat irritation may be caused by the formation of bradykinin in the airway in response to infection, since intranasal administration of bradykinin causes symptoms of rhinitis and a sore throat.15,19 The sensation of throat irritation as an early URTI symptom may develop into sore throat pain associated with nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, or tonsillitis and these conditions may also be associated with bacterial infection.20 The symptom of sore throat is most likely caused by the actions of prostaglandins and bradykinin on sensory nerve endings in the airway and the sensation of pain is mediated by the cranial nerves supplying the nasopharynx and pharynx.","# Sore throat

# Sneezing
Sneezing, like sore throat, is a prominent early symptom associated with URTIs.7 Sneezing is mediated solely by the trigeminal nerves, which supply the nasal epithelium and the anterior part of the nasopharynx with sensory fibres.21,22 Sneezing is related to inflammatory responses in the nose and nasopharynx that stimulate the trigeminal nerves. The sneeze response may be mediated via histamine receptors on the trigeminal nerves, since intranasal administration of histamine causes sneezing.23 The trigeminal nerves relay information to the sneeze centre in the brainstem and cause reflex activation of motor and parasympathetic branches of the facial nerve and activate respiratory muscles. A model of the sneeze reflex is illustrated in figure 1. The sneeze centre coordinates the inspiratory and expiratory actions of sneezing via respiratory muscles, and lacrimation and nasal congestion via parasympathetic branches of the facial nerve. The eyes are always closed during sneezing by activation of facial muscles, indicating a close relation between the protective reflexes of the nose and eyes. A common phenomenon is the ""photic sneeze"", caused by a sudden increase in light intensity, again highlighting the overlap of protective nasal and eye reflexes.24 Sneezing activates parasympathetic pathways to nasal glands and there appears to be some cholinergic control of sneezing, since anticholinergics such as ipratropium and first generation antihistamines have been shown to inhibit sneezing.25,26","# Sneezing

From each of these three dark blue nodes, a dark blue line with an arrow points downwards, indicating outputs. These outputs lead to three distinct labels: 'Respiratory muscles', 'Facial muscles', and 'Nasal lacrimal glands'. Below these three labels, the word 'SNEEZE' is written in red, signifying the outcome of this reflex.

Graph A (Common Cold):
- The blue line (left nasal airway resistance) starts high at approximately 4.8 Pa/cm³ s⁻¹ at 0 minutes, fluctuates, then drops significantly to around 0.2 Pa/cm³ s⁻¹ by 200 minutes, remaining low thereafter.
- The red line (right nasal airway resistance) starts low at approximately 0.2 Pa/cm³ s⁻¹ at 0 minutes, remains low until around 175 minutes, then rises sharply to approximately 1.0 Pa/cm³ s⁻¹ at 200 minutes, and further increases to a peak of about 3.4 Pa/cm³ s⁻¹ around 275 minutes, before stabilizing around 1.4 Pa/cm³ s⁻¹.
- This graph shows a clear inverse relationship between the left and right nasal airway resistance, with generally higher resistance values, especially during the initial phase for the left nostril and later for the right nostril.

Graph B (Healthy):
- Both the blue line (left nasal airway resistance) and the red line (right nasal airway resistance) show consistently low resistance values, generally fluctuating between 0.2 and 1.0 Pa/cm³ s⁻¹ throughout the 400-minute period.
- The lines frequently cross each other, indicating normal nasal cycling, but at significantly lower and more stable resistance levels compared to Graph A.::>","<::chart: The image displays two line graphs, labeled A and B, showing spontaneous changes in unilateral nasal airway resistance over time.

# Nasal congestion
Nasal congestion is a later symptom of URTIs that increases in severity over the first week of symptoms.7 Nasal congestion is caused by the dilation of large veins in the nasal epithelium (venous sinuses) in response to the generation of vasodilator mediators of inflammation such as bradykinin.31,32 These sinuses are well developed at the anterior end of the inferior turbinate and nasal septum where congestion of the sinuses in the narrow nasal valve region causes obstruction of the nasal airway.33 The nasal venous sinuses exhibit phases of congestion and decongestion under the influence of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves, causing reciprocal changes in nasal airflow (often termed the ""nasal cycle"").33 The asymmetry of nasal airflow associated with the nasal cycle is increased with an URTI, and this may result in one nasal passage being patent while the other is completely obstructed.34 Figure 2 illustrates the changes in nasal airflow associated with the nasal cycle in health and with an URTI.","# Nasal congestion

## Cough
Cough is a common symptom associated with URTIs that may persist for 3 weeks or more, and it represents the largest single cause of consultation in primary care. Cough is mediated exclusively by the vagus nerve, meaning that cough is initiated in the airway by stimulation of sensory nerves at the level of the larynx or below. A model of cough control is illustrated in figure 3. Nasal stimulation and inflammation causes sneezing and not cough, indicating that the airway inflammation associated with rhinitis must reach the level of the larynx to trigger cough. The vagus nerve also supplies the external ear, oesophagus, and abdominal organs and cough can be elicited from these areas as with cough associated with gastroesophageal reflux. Cough is normally a protective reflex that prevents the aspiration of food and fluid into the airway and also aids in the expulsion of mucus and foreign objects from the lower airway. The first days of an URTI are often associated with a dry, unproductive cough that serves no useful function and may cause loss of sleep and exhaustion. The unproductive cough may be caused by the inflammatory response in the upper airways spreading to the larynx. Cough associated with URTIs is believed to be caused by a hyper-reactivity of the cough reflex that may be due to the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway sensory nerve endings. In health, cough is readily induced by mechanical stimulation of the larynx, but when the larynx is inflamed and hyper-reactive, cough may occur spontaneously or in response to stimuli that would not normally cause cough—eg, the mildly irritating effects of cold air. Cough occurs spontaneously with an URTI, and some cough may be voluntary rather than reflex; this voluntary cough may be related to a sensation of airway irritation. Productive cough usually occurs later in the course of URTI and may be related to the inflammation spreading to the lower airways and triggering mucus production. Common cold viruses usually do not cause any substantial damage to the airway epithelium, whereas influenza may cause substantial cellular damage to the respiratory","## Cough

Headache is a common early symptom associated with URTIs.7 In a clinical trial that recruited patients with sore throat associated with URTIs, over 60% of patients experienced headache.49 The mechanism of headache associated with URTIs is unknown but a hypothesis has been proposed that headache associated with infections is caused by cytokines released from immune cells in response to viral infection.50 Administration of cytokines involved in the immune response to infection—eg, tumour necrosis factor and interferons—has been shown to cause headache in human beings.50 Headache is a common side-effect of administration of interferon beta-1a for the treatment of multiple sclerosis;51 similarly headache is associated with therapy with pegylated interferon alpha-2b for treatment of hepatitis.52 The mechanism of headache caused by cytokines is unknown but it is interesting that headache induced by cytokines is accompanied by symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, malaise, nausea, and depression, and these symptoms are commonly associated with URTIs.","# Headache

One pathway shows the cytokines acting on vagal nerves, which then send signals to the hypothalamus. The second pathway shows the cytokines directly entering the brain to reach the hypothalamus temperature control centre. From the hypothalamus, signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, leading to a 'Sensation of chilliness'. Additionally, the hypothalamus triggers 'Shivering' and 'Constriction skin blood vessels'.

## Psychological effects, malaise, and mood changes
The presence of physical features of URTIs—eg, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, and cough—may cause discomfort, attention deficit, and mood changes but there is increasing evidence that the psychological changes associated with URTIs may also be caused by the effects of cytokines on the central nervous system.⁵⁷ URTIs have been shown to lead to a reduction in subjective alertness and impaired psychomotor functioning⁵⁸ but the relative contribution of cytokines to these changes is poorly understood. Exogenous administration of interferon alpha is used as a therapy for chronic viral diseases such as hepatitis B and C, and therapy is associated with flu-like side-effects similar to those observed with URTIs—eg, fatigue, fever, chills myalgia, nausea, and mood changes.⁵⁹ Psychiatric side-effects such as depression, irritability, lack of motivation, impaired concentration, psychoses, and confusional states have been reported to occur in some patients after 2–3 months of therapy with interferon alpha.⁵⁹ The present knowledge on the effects of interferon alpha on the brain indicates that there at least two distinct syndromes related to therapy: an early neurovegetative syndrome characterised by psychomotor slowing and fatigue, and a later mood/cognitive syndrome that involves depression.⁶⁰ Cytokines—including tumour necrosis factor and interleukins 1, 2, and 6—have been reported to induce the syndrome of “sickness behaviour” with anhedonia, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety/irritability, psychomotor slowing, anergia/fatigue, anorexia, sleep alterations, and increased sensitivity to pain.⁶⁰ These cytokines are also associated with URTIs and may mediate mood changes associated with these infections.","## Psychological effects, malaise, and mood changes

""feed a cold and starve a fever"".61 In association with fever, decreased food and water consumption are the most common signs of infection.13 There is growing evidence that anorexia associated with infections such as URTIs is mediated by cytokines that are released from leucocytes in response to infection, and that these cytokines cause inhibition of feeding by effects on the feeding centre in the hypothalamus.62 The cytokines implicated in anorexia are those involved in the acute phase response to infection—eg, interleukins, tumour necrosis factor, and interferons.62 In support of the folklore advice to starve a fever, evidence indicates that acute anorexia in response to infection is beneficial and that it is an important behavioural response to help overcome infection. Anorexia may aid in eliminating infection by saving energy that would be otherwise used in finding food, reducing heat loss from the body that would be lost by convection, reducing the availability of micronutrients such as iron and zinc that are essential for the growth of pathogens, and enhancement of immune function by enhancing monocyte and macrophage activity.13,62","""feed a cold and starve a fever"".61 In association with fever, decreased food and water consumption are the most common signs of infection.13 There is growing evidence that anorexia associated with infections such as URTIs is mediated by cytokines that are released from leucocytes in response to infection, and that these cytokines cause inhibition of feeding by effects on the feeding centre in the hypothalamus.62 The cytokines implicated in anorexia are those involved in the acute phase response to infection—eg, interleukins, tumour necrosis factor, and interferons.62 In support of the folklore advice to starve a fever, evidence indicates that acute anorexia in response to infection is beneficial and that it is an important behavioural response to help overcome infection.

# Muscle aches and pains
Muscle aches and pains (myalgia) are a common symptom of URTIs, with around 50% of patients with common cold experiencing these symptoms.49 Myalgia is a symptom of the acute phase response to infection and there is evidence that the symptom is caused by the effects of cytokines on skeletal muscle.63 Proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated as inducing the breakdown of muscle proteins, and tumour necrosis factor was initially referred to as cachetin because of its role in causing muscle wasting or cachexia.64 The breakdown of muscle protein in response to URTI can be viewed as beneficial because it mobilises proteins and aminoacids that can be converted in the liver to opsonins and other components of the immune response.64 Fever associated with URTIs is usually accompanied by other systemic symptoms such as myalgia and there is much evidence that indicates that both these symptoms are caused by the production of prostaglandin E2 in response to circulating cytokines.63 The cytokine-induced generation of prostaglandin E2 and the breakdown of skeletal muscle in vitro is inhibited by indomethacin,63 and similarly myalgia associated with URTIs is relieved with acetylsalicylic acid.49 Prostaglandin E2 is a mediator of pain by its effects on peripheral pain receptors.65 The cytokine stimulation of prostaglandin E2 production in skeletal muscle, and the effects of prostaglandin E2 on sensory nerves in muscle, may explain the myalgia associated with URTIs.","# Muscle aches and pains

The time course of an early symptom (sneezing) is compared with that of a later symptom (cough) in figure 5.

Fever is usually an early symptom of influenza but is of short duration (3–4 days). The systemic symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, and anorexia are related to the effects of cytokines released from immune cells and these responses develop rapidly in the first days of infection when the virus is detected by the immune system. The local symptoms of nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea are dependent on the generation of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and bradykinin. The inflammatory mediator response may have a slower onset and longer duration than the cytokine response, which may explain the time course of local symptoms such as congestion and rhinorrhoea.","Fever is usually an early symptom of influenza but is of short duration (3–4 days).

the symptoms of URTI are perceived as a nuisance, but this review suggests that some of the symptoms are an integral part of the acute phase response and may aid in recovery from infection. The unpleasant symptoms of fever, malaise, and anorexia help to overcome infection and it is debatable whether elimination of these symptoms with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is beneficial. At present there is no evidence that symptomatic treatment of URTIs interferes with the course of the common cold or influenza but this is an area that is worthy of more research.","the symptoms of URTI are perceived as a nuisance, but this review suggests that some of the symptoms are an integral part of the acute phase response and may aid in recovery from infection.

Two hundred young adults with common colds were studied during a 10-month period. Virus culture, antigen detection, PCR, and serology with paired samples were used to identify the infection. Viral etiology was established for 138 of the 200 patients (69%). Rhinoviruses were detected in 105 patients, coronavirus OC43 or 229E infection was detected in 17, influenza A or B virus was detected in 12, and single infections with parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus were found in 14 patients. Evidence for bacterial infection was found in seven patients. Four patients had a rise in antibodies against *Chlamydia pneumoniae*, one had a rise in antibodies against *Haemophilus influenzae*, one had a rise in antibodies against *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and one had immunoglobulin M antibodies against *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*. The results show that although approximately 50% of episodes of the common cold were caused by rhinoviruses, the etiology can vary depending on the epidemiological situation with regard to circulating viruses. Bacterial infections were rare, supporting the concept that the common cold is almost exclusively a viral disease.","Two hundred young adults with common colds were studied during a 10-month period.

Large studies, such as the Tecumseh Study, the Seattle Virus Watch, and the New York Virus Watch, performed during the 1960s clarified the crucial role of viruses in acute respiratory illness (23). Rhinoviruses were shown to be major causative agents in mild upper respiratory illness (the common cold), although the percentage of rhinoviruses detected in disease episodes was approximately 25% in the early studies (17). Rhinoviruses have been recently estimated to cause 34% of all respiratory illnesses (23). With the exception of coronaviruses, the proportion of other identified agents has been small, and in most studies the causative agent has not been identified in up to 50% of cases. Since there are several prospects for antiviral chemotherapy and new treatments for the common cold, investigation of the etiology of the disease is of importance. The present policy for treatment of the common cold should also be evaluated in view of the causative agents, since in the United States antibiotics are prescribed for 60% of patients (22).","Large studies, such as the Tecumseh Study, the Seattle Virus Watch, and the New York Virus Watch, performed during the 1960s clarified the crucial role of viruses in acute respiratory illness (23).

Although during the past two decades methods for virolog-ical diagnostics have greatly improved, no recent prospective study of the etiology of the common cold has been published. Most clinical trials dealing with therapy have not employed extensive testing of viruses causing the disease, which weakens their value (25). In order to optimize microbial detection, we have employed several virological and bacteriological methods to study 200 young adults with symptoms and signs of the common cold.","Although during the past two decades methods for virolog-ical diagnostics have greatly improved, no recent prospective study of the etiology of the common cold has been published.

Hospital, which patients contacted within 24 to 48 h after the onset of symptoms of the common cold. For inclusion in the study, patients had to self-diagnose the common cold based on their earlier experience of symptoms. In addition, clinical evidence of acute rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and/or sore throat was confirmed by the study physician. Patients with tonsillitis and with previous histories of allergic rhinitis, any chronic illness, or use of regular medication were excluded. One study physician (T.P.) and one nurse examined all the patients participating in the study. The patients were all Caucasian. The mean age of the patients was 24.0 years for male students (n = 59) and 24.1 years for female students (n = 141). The study protocol was accepted by the ethical committee of the Turku University Hospital. A written informed consent was obtained from each patient.","Hospital, which patients contacted within 24 to 48 h after the onset of symptoms of the common cold.

At the first visit, a nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected with a disposable mucus extractor from all the patients. Disposable plastic gloves were used, and all surfaces were wiped with disinfectant to avoid possible contamination among the patients. Three sterile cotton swabs were dipped into the mucus, and these were then placed in separate viral transport medium tubes (0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics in tryptose phosphate broth) for PCR assay and virus culture. The rest of the mucus was used for virus antigen detection. All virus culture tubes were immediately frozen at -70°C prior to subsequent processing. A blood sample was collected for serological analyses. The patients returned on day 7, when a new nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken.

For measuring coronavirus antibodies, crude EIA antigens (microsomal fraction) were prepared from coronavirus OC43- and 229E-infected cells and uninfected control antigen RD cells (human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells) as described for mouse brain homogenate (13). Seeds for virus and cells (originally from the American Type Culture Collection) were kindly provided by K. Holmes (University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, Md.). Microtiter plates with 96 wells (Maxisorb; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with each of the antigens (2.5 µg/ml) and used in a standard single-dilution (1:200) EIA procedure with the sera in duplicate. Known positive and negative sera were used to control inter-assay variation. Criteria for a significant increase or decrease between the titers were determined in advance, and a twofold-or-greater difference in specific absorbances of paired sera was found to be a reliable marker. Assay of serial dilutions of the paired sera was used to clarify equivocal results.","For measuring coronavirus antibodies, crude EIA antigens (microsomal fraction) were prepared from coronavirus OC43- and 229E-infected cells and uninfected control antigen RD cells (human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells) as described for mouse brain homogenate (13).

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to pneumococcal pneumolysin and C-polysaccharide were measured by EIA as described earlier, and a twofold-or-higher rise in antibody levels between paired sera was considered diagnostic (18). Antibodies to nontypeable *Haemophilus influenzae* and *Moraxella catarrhalis* were measured by EIA using whole bacterial cell antigen (a mixture of 10 different strains), and a threefold-or-higher antibody rise between paired sera was considered diagnostic for acute infection (6). IgG and IgM antibodies to chlamydial species were measured by a microimmunofluorescence method by using elementary bodies of *Chlamydia pneumoniae* Kajaani 7 and *Chlamydia trachomatis* 1.2 as antigens as described elsewhere (7), except that the sera were incubated overnight. The presence of IgM antibodies and/or a fourfold-or-greater change in antibody levels between paired sera was considered diagnostic for acute chlamydial infection. These antibody assays have been successfully used in the etiological diagnosis of pneumonia in children both in industrialized and developing countries (28, 29).","Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to pneumococcal pneumolysin and C-polysaccharide were measured by EIA as described earlier, and a twofold-or-higher rise in antibody levels between paired sera was considered diagnostic (18).

## RESULTS
Virological findings. Evidence for virus infection was found in 138 of the 200 patients (69%). Rhinovirus was found in 105 patients (52.5%) by virus culture or PCR. The percentage of rhinoviruses was the same in both males and females. Overall, results by virus culture and PCR had a high level of agreement: 78% of the PCR-positive samples were also culture positive (80 of 103 patients). Coronaviruses were the second most common group of causative agents and were detected in 17 patients by serology. A total of 12 patients had influenza A or B virus infection (Table 1).","## RESULTS

This study shows that in addition to virus culture, serology and PCR techniques are needed to detect the maximal number of infections. Although virus culture remains the ""gold stan-dard"" (yield, 45.5% with only two cell lines), more sensitive PCR methods, especially for rhinoviruses (yield, 51.5%), are increasingly used in routine diagnostics. Interestingly, the rapid test for seven different virus antigens was positive for only 9% of the patients. This observation agrees with earlier studies with adults (14, 21). For children, virus antigen detection is often the method of choice (12, 26). Virus antigen tests are sensitive for RSV and adenoviruses, which are common in young children but rare in adults, as seen also in this study (12, 27). Another factor contributing to the low yield of antigen-positive samples may be that adults shed less virus than chil-dren (8, 23).","This study shows that in addition to virus culture, serology and PCR techniques are needed to detect the maximal number of infections.

Rhinoviruses were the causative agent of the common cold in half of the cases in this investigation. During the 2-month outbreak during the fall, 92% of the patients had rhinovirus-induced illness. This observation agrees with results of a recent study, in which rhinovirus was detected in 276 of 346 (80%) common-cold patients during a 4-month epidemic fall season (4). Herzog and coworkers detected rhinoviruses in 55% of 122 patients with acute upper respiratory tract infections (11). Although rhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold, it must be stressed that almost half of the cases are caused by other viruses. We detected rhinoviruses, RSVs, influenza A viruses, adenoviruses, and parainfluenza type 3 viruses circulating in the community at the same time (Fig. 1c). These infections are often clinically indistinguishable in adults. This observation emphasizes the need to identify the specific virus in studies of specific antivirals.","Rhinoviruses were the causative agent of the common cold in half of the cases in this investigation.

We studied bacterial cultures performed with nasopharyn-geal samples for beta-hemolytic streptococci and serologic re-sponses for five additional bacteria. None of the patients had beta-hemolytic group A Streptococcus in their nasopharynges. Interestingly, we found serological evidence of concomitant bacterial infection in seven patients. One of them, with H. influenzae infection, developed acute otitis media. The other patients, with infections with S. pneumoniae (n = 1), Myco-plasma pneumoniae (n = 1), and C. pneumoniae (n = 4), recovered similarly to other common-cold patients without antibiotics. Recently, Kaiser et al. suggested that nasopharyn-geal carriage of H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae (in 20% of their patients) would indicate a bacterial infection in patients with symptoms and signs of the common cold (19). In these patients, antibiotic treatment shortened the duration of symptoms compared to the duration for culture-negative patients. By using serological techniques (6, 7, 18), we found evidence for these infections in only 1% of our patients.

None of the patients had beta-hemolytic group A Streptococcus in their nasopharynges. Interestingly, we found serological evidence of concomitant bacterial infection in seven patients. One of them, with H. influenzae infection, developed acute otitis media.

ment of the common cold is not beneficial. In spite of that, it has been shown that up to 60% of patients with common colds receive an antibiotic, which results in an estimated cost of $37.5 million per year in the United States (22). This treatment policy results in problems not only with the cost but, even more importantly, also with emerging antibiotic resistance of bacte-ria. An Icelandic study showed an obvious association of anti-biotic use in the community with the prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci (2).
Even though we used a large battery of diagnostic tests, there are some limitations to our study. To optimize the cost/ benefit ratio of virus isolation, patient samples were inoculated into two cell lines which pick up rhinoviruses well but other respiratory viruses only moderately. By using the best available cell line for each virus, it would be possible to reach an even higher yield of virus-positive cultures. Moreover, PCR tech-niques are often more sensitive than the conventional virus culture method for detection of microbes and PCR could be used for other viruses as well.","ment of the common cold is not beneficial.

In routine clinical practice, there is no need to do etiological diagnosis of the common cold. The price is too high (in this study, $700/patient), and, except in the case of the rapid influ- enza A test, the results may not change the treatment. The implications of this study, nevertheless, are clear. The common cold is a viral illness for which the etiology can be shown in most cases. Bacterial coinfections are very rare. Antibiotic treatment is not necessary in otherwise healthy young adults with common colds.","In routine clinical practice, there is no need to do etiological diagnosis of the common cold.

The role of vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of the common cold has been a subject of controversy for at least 60 years. Public interest in the subject, stimulated originally by the vigorous advocacy of Nobel laureate Linus Pauling during the 1970s [1], continues to be high. We have recently updated the Cochrane Review [2] on this topic (Text S1), incorporating 55 comparative studies that have been carried out over a period of 65 years.","The role of vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of the common cold has been a subject of controversy for at least 60 years.

The Updated Review
We sought to discover whether vitamin C in doses of 200 mg or more daily (Figure 1) reduces the incidence, duration, or severity of the common cold when used either as continuous prophylaxis or after the onset of cold symptoms. Criteria for inclusion were placebo-controlled trials to prevent or treat the common cold using oral doses of vitamin C of 200 mg/day or more. Literature from 1940 to 2004 was methodically screened.","The Updated Review

people used prophylaxis prior to
extreme physical exertion and/or

the collective evidence indicates that
vitamin C supplementation may have
a considerable beneficial effect; it was

be exercised in generalizing from
this finding, which is based mainly on
marathon runners.","In special circumstances, where

Vitamin C was identified in the 1930s by Albert Szent-Györgyi, who received his Nobel Prize partly for this work. He found that paprika is a particularly rich source of the vitamin, which made it possible to produce kilograms of it for research purposes ([1963] Annu Rev Biochem 32: 1–14). Nowadays, the most convenient way to increase vitamin C intake is by way of 500-mg tablets, but further research is needed to explore the conditions in which supplementation may be beneficial.","Figure 1. 500-mg Vitamin C Tablets and Paprikas

These meta-analyses were of placebo-controlled trials that provided data on incidence and duration of respiratory episodes during continuous oral prophylaxis, or on duration of respiratory episodes following therapy at onset of colds using doses in excess of 200 mg of vitamin C.
Prophylaxis indicates vitamin C supplementation over the entire study period. All combined results were pooled using the random effects model.
* Heterogeneity between trial outcomes in the group: the χ2 test for heterogeneity with p > 0.05 indicates lack of heterogeneity, and the I² test with P = 0% indicates no evidence of heterogeneity, with 100% being the maximum in the I² scale [5].
b CI, confidence interval; RED, relative effect on duration of colds (e.g., if a seven-day cold is shortened by one day, that corresponds to RED = −14% [= −1/7]); RR, relative risk of colds.
c Statistically significant benefit favours those receiving vitamin C with p < 0.0001.
d Statistically significant benefit favours those receiving vitamin C with p < 0.002.
