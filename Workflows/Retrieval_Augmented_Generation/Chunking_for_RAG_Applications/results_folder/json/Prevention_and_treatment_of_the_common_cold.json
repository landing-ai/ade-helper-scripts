The virus is spread by hand contact with secretions from an infected person (direct or indirect) or aerosol of the secretions and virus.\u00b9 The incubation period varies but is just under two days for rhinovirus.\u00b2 Symptoms, which generally relate to the infected mucosa, typically peak at 1\u20133 days and last 7\u201310 days, although they occasionally persist for three weeks.\u00b9,\u00b3\u207b\u2075 They include sore throat, rhinitis, rhinorrhea, cough and malaise.\u00b9,\u2074 The severity and type of symptoms will vary among individuals and with different infective agents. For example, fever is common in children but rare and mild in adults.\u00b9 The incidence of the common cold declines with age.\u2075\u207b\u2077 Children under two years have about six infections a year, adults two to three and older people about one per year.\u2075\u207b\u2079 Stress\u00b9\u2070 and poor sleep\u00b9\u00b9 may increase the risk of the common cold among adults, whereas attendance at a daycare centre\u00b9\u00b2 increases the risk among preschool children.",

A large systematic review and meta-analysis\u2075\u00b3 found that the antihistamine\u2013decongestant combination reduced global symptoms in six pooled studies (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.50). The estimated number needed to treat was five. Although overall adverse events were not increased, there were significant increases in dry mouth (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.75 to 8.14) and insomnia (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.08 to 8.47). Fewer, and smaller, RCTs examined other combinations, and pooling was limited. For the antihistamine\u2013analgesic combination, two of three studies reported on global symptoms and found significant improvement. For the antihistamine\u2013decongestant\u2013analgesic combination compared with placebo, four trials reported improve-",

A systematic review59 evaluated a variety of outcomes such as cough and global improvement scores in children (age two to seven years), but statistically significant improvements were infrequent and inconsistent and of doubtful clinical significance.59,68 In addition, a Canadian review of codeine for acute cough in children found no benefit when compared with placebo. In adults, antihistamines and codeine had no effect on cough.59 One study of guaifenesin found no benefit; in another, 75% of participants reported that guaifenesin was helpful for their cough, compared with 31% given placebo (p < 0.01).59 Dextromethorphan had mixed results, with two positive trials showing a 12%-36% improvement in cough scores (p < 0.05).59 Combination products seemed to have some benefit, but there is little consistency in outcomes and it is not clear whether all negative outcomes were reported. Poor trial quality, varying reported outcomes and inconsistent results limit interpretation.59",

In the one RCT60 we found that assessed its efficacy, harms appeared to outweigh benefits. No effect was found on rhinorrhea.

Scores for child and parental sleep were both significantly improved with vapour rub versus petrolatum (p = 0.008 or better). For the combination of all scales (range 6\u201342), vapour rub had an improved score of about 4 higher than petrolatum (p = 0.03).

The virus is spread by hand contact with secretions from an infected person (direct or indirect) or aerosol of the secretions and virus.\u00b9 The incubation period varies but is just under two days for rhinovirus.\u00b2 Symptoms, which generally relate to the infected mucosa, typically peak at 1\u20133 days and last 7\u201310 days, although they occasionally persist for three weeks.\u00b9,\u00b3\u207b\u2075 They include sore throat, rhinitis, rhinorrhea, cough and malaise.\u00b9,\u2074 The severity and type of symptoms will vary among individuals and with different infective agents. For example, fever is common in children but rare and mild in adults.\u00b9 The incidence of the common cold declines with age.\u2075\u207b\u2077 Children under two years have about six infections a year, adults two to three and older people about one per year.\u2075\u207b\u2079 Stress\u00b9\u2070 and poor sleep\u00b9\u00b9 may increase the risk of the common cold among adults, whereas attendance at a daycare centre\u00b9\u00b2 increases the risk among preschool children.\n\n<a id='6b18046b-ae21-4ee8-9999-5f225331cf87'></a>\n\nRhinovirus accounts for 24%\u201352% of clinical cases or 52%\u201376% of infections with an identified pathogen.6\u20138,13 No pathogen is identified in 31%\u201357% of upper respiratory tract infections,8,13 likely because of a host of reasons, including poor collection technique, low pathogen count due to sampling late in the illness, or previously unidentified agents.1 Only about 5% of clinically diagnosed cases were found to have bacterial infection (with or without viral co-infection).13\nAlthough self-limiting, the common cold is\n\n<a id='cda75637-5a80-411c-a5e7-0e974c97b2c7'></a>\n\n## KEY POINTS\n* Evidence for interventions aimed at preventing and treating the common cold is frequently of poor quality, and results are inconsistent.\n* The best evidence for the prevention of the common cold supports physical interventions (e.g., handwashing) and possibly the use of zinc supplements.\n* The best evidence for traditional treatments supports the use of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for pain and fever) and possibly antihistamine-decongestant combinations and intranasal ipratropium. Ibuprofen appears to be superior to acetaminophen for the treatment of fever in children.\n* The best evidence for nontraditional treatments of the common cold supports the use of oral zinc supplements in adults and honey at bedtime for cough in children over one year.\n\n<a id='6b23a3de-a9b3-4925-9f0f-900af80b5e4b'></a>\n\nhighly prevalent and may be debilitating. It causes declines in function and productivity at work\u00b9\u2074,\u00b9\u2075 and may affect other activities such as driving.\u00b9\u2076 Its impact on society and health care is large. Of individuals with an upper respiratory tract infection, 7%\u201317% of adults\u00b9\u2077,\u00b9\u2078 and 33% of children\u00b9\u2077 visit a physician. Upper respiratory tract infections result in an estimated increase of 12.5% in patient visits per month during cold and flu season.\u00b9\u2079 In the United States, direct medical costs related to the common cold (physician visits, secondary infections and medications) were an estimated $17 billion a year in 1997.\u00b9\u2077 Indirect costs owing to missed work because of illness or caring for an ill child were an estimated $25 billion a year.\u00b9\u2077\n\n<a id='8b33d53b-2d45-422d-bcf5-1c028de4f408'></a>\n\nWe review the evidence underpinning preven-\ntive and treatment interventions for the common\ncold. We do not explore the proposed biologic\nmechanisms for the different products, because\nmost are not substantiated and generally represent\nmore supposition than science. The quality of the\nevidence was frequently poor, with a moderate to\nhigh risk of bias. Although preventive interventions\nhave somewhat discrete outcomes (presence of an\nupper respiratory tract infection), interpretation of\nthe evidence for treatment of the common cold is\nchallenged by the complexity of outcome\nreporting. The evidence used in this review is\ndescribed in Box 1.\n\n<a id='52575ef9-4d38-4323-9d27-4a394b48cb6b'></a>\n\nHow can the common cold\nbe distinguished from other\nconditions?\n\nThe symptoms and signs of the common cold\noverlap with those of other conditions. Allergic\nrhinitis presents similarly, but it may have a sea-\nsonal component or clear allergic aggravation\nand is unlikely to have an accompanying sore\nthroat. When sore throat is the primary com-\nplaint, streptococcal pharyngitis should be con-\nsidered.

As a result, pooling of data was limited, and many of the studies had an unclear or high risk of bias. Nevertheless, the majority of results suggested that physical preventive measures such as handwashing reduced the risk of getting or spreading upper respiratory tract infections.\n\n<a id='de673659-869e-4c71-b09f-592e01a1e939'></a>\n\n**Zinc**\nZinc appears to be effective in reducing the number\nof colds per year, at least in children. A Cochrane\nreview31 of the prophylactic efficacy of orally\nadministered zinc considered two RCTs that we\n\n<a id='cabf29d1-1692-4d0d-b21c-e6b5f5093a47'></a>\n\nalso examined individually.32,33 These studies had methodologic concerns and included only children given zinc sulfate 10 mg or 15 mg daily. The mean number of colds was significantly lower in the zinc group than in the placebo group both in the pooled analysis (Table 1) and in the individual studies (mean 1.2 v. 1.7 [p = 0.003] in one trial32 and 1.7 v. 3.1 [p < 0.001] in the other33). School absences were significantly lower in the zinc groups of each study, by an average of 0.4 days (p = 0.04)32 and 0.8 days (p < 0.001).33 Antibiotic use was also significantly lower in the zinc groups of each study (5 v. 18 [p = 0.009]32 and 20 v. 47 [p < 0.001]33 respectively). In one of the studies,32 the proportion of children with no colds during the study period was 33% in the zinc group versus 14% in the control group, for a number needed to treat of six.\n\n<a id='b974ebec-38f8-4891-af0f-73a067254fc9'></a>\n\nAlthough the evidence for cold prevention with zinc comes from studies involving only children, there is no biological reason why zinc would work only in children and not adults.\n\n<a id='452a9916-45a5-4cc7-81f9-e369e51caf07'></a>\n\n# Probiotics\n\nProbiotics may be helpful in preventing upper respiratory tract infections, but the interventions and evidence are inconsistent. A systematic review of 14 RCTs included 10 trials (n = 3451) that provided sufficient data for pooling.34 Pediatric and adult populations from a wide variety of countries were included. Probiotic prophylaxis reduced the number of participants who had one or more upper respiratory tract infections (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36 to 0.92) and the number of upper respiratory tract infections per person-year (rate ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). Both outcomes had inconsistent results in the individual studies, reflected in estimates of heterogeneity (P = 69% and 44%, respectively).\n\n<a id='ff6f6f5d-22dc-43b3-a49d-b83fdef571fb'></a>\n\n### Box 1: Summary of literature review\n\nIn July and August 2012, a literature search was performed by one of us (G.M.A.) of PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, *ACP Journal Club* and *Evidence-Based Medicine*. Search terms included \"common cold\" and \"upper respiratory tract infection.\" In PubMed, the search was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Individual treatments were also searched (e.g., \"vitamin C\"). A similar search was performed in early 2012 by B.A. for a related project. We conducted a manual search of the bibliographies of included articles. Further details of the literature search are available from the authors upon request.\n\n<a id='02dbba8e-9646-4b41-9008-eee367e5192d'></a>\n\nWe selected the highest level of evidence available for each intervention, focusing on systematic reviews (with or without a meta-analysis) and RCTs. We rated the quality of evidence for each intervention as high, moderate or low risk of bias. For systematic reviews, we considered the authors' assessment of methodologic quality (e.g., blinding) of included trials but also examined the quality of the systematic review itself (e.g., thoroughness of the literature search). For RCTs, we considered traditional validity criteria (e.g., allocation concealment) as well other limitations (e.g., funding or restricted populations). Lastly, we considered the overall volume (size and number of RCTs) and the consistency of the evidence. We used lower levels of evidence for general information such as epidemiology.\n\n<a id='e888682c-628b-490d-9920-dfaf8ed42b7d'></a>\n\nCMAJ, February 18, 2014, 186(3)\n\n<a id='2f3ee17a-b169-493f-b0d1-89a29dffd20e'></a>\n\n191\n\n<a id='56f43acc-90c7-4e57-8a23-b600b54f49e9'></a>\n\nREVIEW\n\n<a id='496e9488-90ba-4be9-907c-e1d723623593'></a>\n\nHowever, use of probiotics reduced antibiotic use (risk ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98). In all but two studies, the probiotics varied in types of organisms, combinations of organisms, formulations (e.g., pills, liquids) and quantity (colony-forming units). These inconsistencies limit the clinical application of the study findings.\n\n<a id='31ae3e44-7606-4103-b54a-b2663834b91d'></a>\n\nWe examined the two highest-quality studies included in the systematic review. In the first,\u00b3\u2075 638 children aged three to six years attending a community preschool or daycare were randomly assigned to receive either a drink containing the probiotic strain *Lactobacillus casei* DN-114 001 (10\u2078 colony-forming units) or a matching placebo for 90 days. Use of the probiotic resulted in a reduction of 0.6 upper respiratory tract infections per 100 person-days (*p* = 0.036). In the second RCT,\u00b3\u2076 742 children more than 12 months of age who were admitted to hospital were randomly assigned to drink 100 mL of a fermented milk product containing either *Lac*-\n\n<a id='cf75ce7a-c3e7-42c9-a87c-53a20670c629'></a>\n\ntobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (10\u2079 colony-forming units) or no probiotic for the duration of their hospital stay.

A systematic review59 evaluated a variety of outcomes such as cough and global improvement scores in children (age two to seven years), but statistically significant improvements were infrequent and inconsistent and of doubtful clinical significance.59,68 In addition, a Canadian review of codeine for acute cough in children found no benefit when compared with placebo. In adults, antihistamines and codeine had no effect on cough.59 One study of guaifenesin found no benefit; in another, 75% of participants reported that guaifenesin was helpful for their cough, compared with 31% given placebo (p < 0.01).59 Dextromethorphan had mixed results, with two positive trials showing a 12%-36% improvement in cough scores (p < 0.05).59 Combination products seemed to have some benefit, but there is little consistency in outcomes and it is not clear whether all negative outcomes were reported. Poor trial quality, varying reported outcomes and inconsistent results limit interpretation.59\n\n<a id='94e21e28-b1c8-4228-bcd4-63fb618387f1'></a>\n\nVapour rub\nVapour rub containing camphor, menthol and eucalyptus oil is applied to the neck and chest. In the one RCT60 we found that assessed its efficacy, harms appeared to outweigh benefits. No effect was found on rhinorrhea. Scores for cough frequency and severity were improved compared with no treatment (p = 0.006 or better) but not compared with petrolatum (placebo). Scores for child and parental sleep were both significantly improved with vapour rub versus petrolatum (p = 0.008 or better). For the combination of all scales (range 6\u201342), vapour rub had an improved score of about 4 higher than petrolatum (p = 0.03). However, significantly increased adverse events over placebo included burning sensation to the skin (28%), nose (14%) and eyes (16%) (p < 0.001 each). Rash and redness of skin each\n\n<a id='5d1e4ae4-18b0-45b8-8665-e2b7dbfaf4a0'></a>\n\noccurred in 5% of patients using vapour rub, com-\npared with none using petrolatum.\n\n<a id='393a513d-3934-4ee3-b9ce-551171faca90'></a>\n\n## Other interventions\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen appear to be effective in relieving pain and fever in people with upper respiratory tract infection but not in relieving other symptoms.61-63 Ibuprofen has been shown to be superior to acetaminophen in fever control, whereas the safety of these drugs, at least in pediatric populations, is equivalent.64,65 Antibiotics have no beneficial effect on the common cold but do increase adverse events.66 Because many symptoms of bacterial upper respiratory tract infections overlap with cold symptoms, clinicians may be tempted to prescribe antibiotics. Although prescribing should be minimized, issuing a delayed prescription for an antibiotic at times of uncertainty has been shown to reduce antibiotic use from 93% to 32%.70\n\n<a id='a419b006-d784-464c-b54f-c2f8827328a1'></a>\n\nSummarized details of these interventions can\nbe found in Table 2.

Zinc did not significantly affect symptom severity in children (standard mean difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.17) but did reduce severity in adults (standard mean difference -0.64, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.24).74 Although the data were posi-\n\n<a id='572bd967-5801-4e0d-a10e-733a77a6bcdc'></a>\n\ntive for adults, heterogeneity was consistently high in all results (_P_ = 55% to 95%), which reflected a high level of inconsistency, even in subgroup testing.74 Use of oral zinc supplements was associated with an increased risk of adverse events such as bad taste and nausea (risk ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.46).74 It is unclear why oral zinc treatment seems to benefit adults more than children.\n\n<a id='4dd0dfc2-a57f-4a6e-af98-a324838a3fda'></a>\n\nThe evidence to support intranasal use of zinc is weak, and important risks exist.

The virus is spread by hand contact with secretions from an infected person (direct or indirect) or aerosol of the secretions and virus.\u00b9 The incubation period varies but is just under two days for rhinovirus.\u00b2 Symptoms, which generally relate to the infected mucosa, typically peak at 1\u20133 days and last 7\u201310 days, although they occasionally persist for three weeks.\u00b9,\u00b3\u207b\u2075 They include sore throat, rhinitis, rhinorrhea, cough and malaise.\u00b9,\u2074 The severity and type of symptoms will vary among individuals and with different infective agents. For example, fever is common in children but rare and mild in adults.\u00b9 The incidence of the common cold declines with age.\u2075\u207b\u2077 Children under two years have about six infections a year, adults two to three and older people about one per year.\u2075\u207b\u2079 Stress\u00b9\u2070 and poor sleep\u00b9\u00b9 may increase the risk of the common cold among adults, whereas attendance at a daycare centre\u00b9\u00b2 increases the risk among preschool children.\n\n<a id='6b18046b-ae21-4ee8-9999-5f225331cf87'></a>\n\nRhinovirus accounts for 24%\u201352% of clinical cases or 52%\u201376% of infections with an identified pathogen.6\u20138,13 No pathogen is identified in 31%\u201357% of upper respiratory tract infections,8,13 likely because of a host of reasons, including poor collection technique, low pathogen count due to sampling late in the illness, or previously unidentified agents.1 Only about 5% of clinically diagnosed cases were found to have bacterial infection (with or without viral co-infection).13\nAlthough self-limiting, the common cold is\n\n<a id='cda75637-5a80-411c-a5e7-0e974c97b2c7'></a>\n\n## KEY POINTS\n* Evidence for interventions aimed at preventing and treating the common cold is frequently of poor quality, and results are inconsistent.\n* The best evidence for the prevention of the common cold supports physical interventions (e.g., handwashing) and possibly the use of zinc supplements.\n* The best evidence for traditional treatments supports the use of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for pain and fever) and possibly antihistamine-decongestant combinations and intranasal ipratropium. Ibuprofen appears to be superior to acetaminophen for the treatment of fever in children.\n* The best evidence for nontraditional treatments of the common cold supports the use of oral zinc supplements in adults and honey at bedtime for cough in children over one year.\n\n<a id='6b23a3de-a9b3-4925-9f0f-900af80b5e4b'></a>\n\nhighly prevalent and may be debilitating. It causes declines in function and productivity at work\u00b9\u2074,\u00b9\u2075 and may affect other activities such as driving.\u00b9\u2076 Its impact on society and health care is large. Of individuals with an upper respiratory tract infection, 7%\u201317% of adults\u00b9\u2077,\u00b9\u2078 and 33% of children\u00b9\u2077 visit a physician. Upper respiratory tract infections result in an estimated increase of 12.5% in patient visits per month during cold and flu season.\u00b9\u2079 In the United States, direct medical costs related to the common cold (physician visits, secondary infections and medications) were an estimated $17 billion a year in 1997.\u00b9\u2077 Indirect costs owing to missed work because of illness or caring for an ill child were an estimated $25 billion a year.\u00b9\u2077\n\n<a id='8b33d53b-2d45-422d-bcf5-1c028de4f408'></a>\n\nWe review the evidence underpinning preven-\ntive and treatment interventions for the common\ncold. We do not explore the proposed biologic\nmechanisms for the different products, because\nmost are not substantiated and generally represent\nmore supposition than science. The quality of the\nevidence was frequently poor, with a moderate to\nhigh risk of bias. Although preventive interventions\nhave somewhat discrete outcomes (presence of an\nupper respiratory tract infection), interpretation of\nthe evidence for treatment of the common cold is\nchallenged by the complexity of outcome\nreporting. The evidence used in this review is\ndescribed in Box 1.\n\n<a id='52575ef9-4d38-4323-9d27-4a394b48cb6b'></a>\n\nHow can the common cold\nbe distinguished from other\nconditions?\n\nThe symptoms and signs of the common cold\noverlap with those of other conditions. Allergic\nrhinitis presents similarly, but it may have a sea-\nsonal component or clear allergic aggravation\nand is unlikely to have an accompanying sore\nthroat. When sore throat is the primary com-\nplaint, streptococcal pharyngitis should be con-\nsidered.

As a result, pooling of data was limited, and many of the studies had an unclear or high risk of bias. Nevertheless, the majority of results suggested that physical preventive measures such as handwashing reduced the risk of getting or spreading upper respiratory tract infections.\n\n<a id='de673659-869e-4c71-b09f-592e01a1e939'></a>\n\n**Zinc**\nZinc appears to be effective in reducing the number\nof colds per year, at least in children. A Cochrane\nreview31 of the prophylactic efficacy of orally\nadministered zinc considered two RCTs that we\n\n<a id='cabf29d1-1692-4d0d-b21c-e6b5f5093a47'></a>\n\nalso examined individually.32,33 These studies had methodologic concerns and included only children given zinc sulfate 10 mg or 15 mg daily. The mean number of colds was significantly lower in the zinc group than in the placebo group both in the pooled analysis (Table 1) and in the individual studies (mean 1.2 v. 1.7 [p = 0.003] in one trial32 and 1.7 v. 3.1 [p < 0.001] in the other33). School absences were significantly lower in the zinc groups of each study, by an average of 0.4 days (p = 0.04)32 and 0.8 days (p < 0.001).33 Antibiotic use was also significantly lower in the zinc groups of each study (5 v. 18 [p = 0.009]32 and 20 v. 47 [p < 0.001]33 respectively). In one of the studies,32 the proportion of children with no colds during the study period was 33% in the zinc group versus 14% in the control group, for a number needed to treat of six.\n\n<a id='b974ebec-38f8-4891-af0f-73a067254fc9'></a>\n\nAlthough the evidence for cold prevention with zinc comes from studies involving only children, there is no biological reason why zinc would work only in children and not adults.\n\n<a id='452a9916-45a5-4cc7-81f9-e369e51caf07'></a>\n\n# Probiotics\n\nProbiotics may be helpful in preventing upper respiratory tract infections, but the interventions and evidence are inconsistent. A systematic review of 14 RCTs included 10 trials (n = 3451) that provided sufficient data for pooling.34 Pediatric and adult populations from a wide variety of countries were included. Probiotic prophylaxis reduced the number of participants who had one or more upper respiratory tract infections (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36 to 0.92) and the number of upper respiratory tract infections per person-year (rate ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). Both outcomes had inconsistent results in the individual studies, reflected in estimates of heterogeneity (P = 69% and 44%, respectively).\n\n<a id='ff6f6f5d-22dc-43b3-a49d-b83fdef571fb'></a>\n\n### Box 1: Summary of literature review\n\nIn July and August 2012, a literature search was performed by one of us (G.M.A.) of PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, *ACP Journal Club* and *Evidence-Based Medicine*. Search terms included \"common cold\" and \"upper respiratory tract infection.\" In PubMed, the search was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Individual treatments were also searched (e.g., \"vitamin C\"). A similar search was performed in early 2012 by B.A. for a related project. We conducted a manual search of the bibliographies of included articles. Further details of the literature search are available from the authors upon request.\n\n<a id='02dbba8e-9646-4b41-9008-eee367e5192d'></a>\n\nWe selected the highest level of evidence available for each intervention, focusing on systematic reviews (with or without a meta-analysis) and RCTs. We rated the quality of evidence for each intervention as high, moderate or low risk of bias. For systematic reviews, we considered the authors' assessment of methodologic quality (e.g., blinding) of included trials but also examined the quality of the systematic review itself (e.g., thoroughness of the literature search). For RCTs, we considered traditional validity criteria (e.g., allocation concealment) as well other limitations (e.g., funding or restricted populations). Lastly, we considered the overall volume (size and number of RCTs) and the consistency of the evidence. We used lower levels of evidence for general information such as epidemiology.\n\n<a id='e888682c-628b-490d-9920-dfaf8ed42b7d'></a>\n\nCMAJ, February 18, 2014, 186(3)\n\n<a id='2f3ee17a-b169-493f-b0d1-89a29dffd20e'></a>\n\n191\n\n<a id='56f43acc-90c7-4e57-8a23-b600b54f49e9'></a>\n\nREVIEW\n\n<a id='496e9488-90ba-4be9-907c-e1d723623593'></a>\n\nHowever, use of probiotics reduced antibiotic use (risk ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98). In all but two studies, the probiotics varied in types of organisms, combinations of organisms, formulations (e.g., pills, liquids) and quantity (colony-forming units). These inconsistencies limit the clinical application of the study findings.\n\n<a id='31ae3e44-7606-4103-b54a-b2663834b91d'></a>\n\nWe examined the two highest-quality studies included in the systematic review. In the first,\u00b3\u2075 638 children aged three to six years attending a community preschool or daycare were randomly assigned to receive either a drink containing the probiotic strain *Lactobacillus casei* DN-114 001 (10\u2078 colony-forming units) or a matching placebo for 90 days. Use of the probiotic resulted in a reduction of 0.6 upper respiratory tract infections per 100 person-days (*p* = 0.036). In the second RCT,\u00b3\u2076 742 children more than 12 months of age who were admitted to hospital were randomly assigned to drink 100 mL of a fermented milk product containing either *Lac*-\n\n<a id='cf75ce7a-c3e7-42c9-a87c-53a20670c629'></a>\n\ntobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (10\u2079 colony-forming units) or no probiotic for the duration of their hospital stay. The incidence of upper respiratory tract infections was reduced in the probiotic group (relative risk 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.85), for a number needed to treat of 30.\n\n<a id='1033d207-0bc8-46ea-832d-29c99801dfa9'></a>\n\nGargling\nFrequent gargling with water may help reduce\nepisodes of upper respiratory tract infection, but\nevidence is limited to a single study. The well-\ndesigned RCT involved 387 adults randomly\nassigned to gargling with water, gargling with a\ndiluted povidone-iodine solution or usual care\n(control).37 Gargling with the povidone-iodine\nsolution had no effect, whereas gargling with\nwater was effective in reducing the risk of an\nupper respiratory tract infection (30.1% v. 40.8%\nin the control group; p = 0.044), for a number\nneeded to treat of 10.

In adults, antihistamines and codeine had no effect on cough.59 One study of guaifenesin found no benefit; in another, 75% of participants reported that guaifenesin was helpful for their cough, compared with 31% given placebo (p < 0.01).59 Dextromethorphan had mixed results, with two positive trials showing a 12%-36% improvement in cough scores (p < 0.05).59 Combination products seemed to have some benefit, but there is little consistency in outcomes and it is not clear whether all negative outcomes were reported.

Although prescribing should be minimized, issuing a delayed prescription for an antibiotic at times of uncertainty has been shown to reduce antibiotic use from 93% to 32%.70\n\n<a id='a419b006-d784-464c-b54f-c2f8827328a1'></a>\n\nSummarized details of these interventions can\nbe found in Table 2.

Studies of nasal irrigation,75 humidified air,76 Chinese herbal medicines77 and echinacea50 all showed inconsistent results. A single clinical trial of ginseng did not report efficacy outcomes.78 We did not identify any high-level evidence for garlic or probiotics in the treatment of the common cold.\nSummarized details of these interventions can be found in Table 3. See also Appendix 1 for a more detailed discussion of each intervention.\n\n<a id='aacc15da-92d7-4897-9e77-690a2c6ecea8'></a>\n\n## Unanswered questions\n\nIn 1931, the author of a *CMAJ* article on the common cold said, \"The common cold is so common that we are apt to pass it by with a contemptuous gesture, unless, of course, we are the sufferers ourselves.\"81\n\n<a id='717385c4-3950-4498-87d9-56cbe28065b4'></a>\n\nMuch more evidence now exists in this area,\nbut many uncertainties remain regarding inter-\nventions to prevent and treat the common cold.\nWe focused on RCTs and systematic reviews and\nmeta-analyses of RCTs for therapy, but few of\nthe studies had a low risk of bias. However,\nmany of the results were inconsistent and had\nsmall effects (e.g., vitamin C), which arouses\nsuspicion that any noted benefit may represent\nbias rather than a true effect.82 We encourage\nresearchers to perform well-designed RCTs on\npromising treatments or on preventive methods\nwith limited evidence (i.e., gargling or garlic).\nFurther work to help clinicians clearly distin-\nguish the common cold from other upper respira-\ntory tract infections would also be useful.\n\n<a id='6ee5df07-cd89-4f64-a9cc-939c0aa13050'></a>\n\n# References\n1.
