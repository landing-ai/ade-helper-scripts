## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

Certified Environmental Consultants, Inc. (CEC) recently completed additional-due-diligence activities, which included completion of subsurface investigation through the use of geophysical surveying techniques, and the collection and analysis of soil-vapor samples and physical soil samples, from selected site locations, based on historical site records (see following section), current site features, and the results of the geophysical-surveying activities.

<a id='4be4275d-1a3d-486f-ab12-475d9a6aa8b1'></a>

The subject site's location is shown on Figure 1 - Site Location Map. The site location is further delineated on Figure 2 - Assessor's Parcel Map. This report describes the sampling procedures that were followed and underlying rationale, and provides a summary of the investigation's findings.

<a id='743dc4da-b872-4ea1-a433-31c81dced510'></a>

1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the recent sampling program was to investigate if adverse environmental conditions are present at the site, as related to potential environmental concerns that had been identified for the land by others, as described in a previously prepared Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I) report for the subject site. The previous report had been prepared by Environmental Managers & Auditors, Inc. (EMA), out of Calabasas, California, and was dated June 30, 2015.

<a id='a7efd8ae-da66-4470-ad38-badb53af62a1'></a>

Specifically, the earlier EMA report identified past use of portions of the site for service-station (automotive) activities, and prior use of the northern part of the site as a "junk yard", and the current-day presence of a wash-down drain and associated clarifier, as representing potential environmental conditions of concern. Copies of the text portion of the previous Phase I report, as well as pertinent historical site-usage documents that were appended to the Phase I report, have been provided as Appendix A for reference.

<a id='d7a619e7-6abf-4e06-8d2c-ba364db6cba4'></a>

1.2 Involved Parties

This Phase II report was prepared on behalf of current property-ownership representatives, in general accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in a proposal dated July 1, 2015, and subsequent electronic communications.

<a id='8ea01666-b016-4e4b-a6a3-43e08b77b874'></a>

## 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION

The site consists of multiple, contiguous, rectangle-shaped commercial parcels, which collectively occupy an area situated between Bay and Sacramento Streets to the north and south, respectively, with Mateo Street along the western boundary, and additional commercial properties and Santa Fe Street to the east, as reflected on Figure 2.

<a id='5d3e185c-4bf7-4fb6-9f7c-7128377503b4'></a>

The northern portion of the property currently is occupied by a bus-maintenance/offices building, and the southeastern portion of the site is occupied by a three-sided storage shed. Additional current-day features at the site include a wash-down drain and clarifier at a washing station that is located adjacent to the storage shed, and a large, above-ground storage tank (AST) that is used for storage of liquefied propane, and fixtures that were deemed to be indicative of the presence of municipal services (potable water and sanitary sewer) and private-utility (natural gas and electricity) connections.

<a id='2509941d-7056-4a1f-9dc2-3add606930d8'></a>

The remainder of the site is open space that is covered with asphalt and concrete pavement. This open area of the site is used a bus storage/staging area. Asphalt and/or concrete flooring was present inside the warehouse/office building, and inside the storage shed.

<a id='4a069440-b350-4577-bcf2-3de2b56e2bbe'></a>

Multiple gates along the adjacent streets provide access to the site. However, a monitored driveway off Bay Street provides the primary access point for the site's on-site parking/storage areas.

<a id='1e8d3c24-f57c-483c-a4de-dfe25df79a21'></a>

The site buildings currently are occupied by personnel affiliated with a municipal-bus maintenance and services business. Additional site information is included in Appendix A. The general layout of the site can be seen on previously referenced Figure 2, as well as on Figure 3 - Recent Sample Locations.

<a id='064d4946-85ac-432f-beaf-24bfa60e5f29'></a>

3.0 RECENT SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL ACTIVITIES

The herein-described sampling program was completed in order to screen the site's subsurface environment for the presence of adverse petroleum and/or chemical impacts, and assess the nature of any detected environment impacts, at specific locations that were related to previously identified historical site activities/features, geophysical surveying activities, as well as current physical fixtures.

<a id='c7260630-7a7f-45e9-b838-775e0a2eb790'></a>

3.1 Geophysical Surveying

In an effort to screen the site for the presence of in-place underground storage tanks (USTs) or other features of potential concern, the services of Geovision Geophysical Services (GGS), out of Corona, California, were utilized. Geophysical surveying activities were completed at the site on July 24 and July 29, 2015. Specifically, GGS inspected the subsurface environment at accessible areas of the site using magnetometer, high-frequency metal detection, conductivity and/or ground-penetrating radar equipment.

<a id='e90d42e2-ed12-4ed9-a091-f17791928c03'></a>

Site personnel assisted in moving buses and other vehicles and generally provided access to open areas of the site. The presence of the buildings, the AST, and a few broken-down vehicles, limited access to some areas. However, GGS personnel generally were able to screen portions of the site that were previously identified as having been used for historical service-station operations. The various GGS personnel were not given any of the known site-history information, in order to ensure objective interpretation of the result data.

<a id='8e2887a5-23c0-4650-ae49-5e5f6bc1ca8b'></a>

A copy of GGS's recent report is included in Appendix B. With the exception of a linear feature that was identified by GGS's conductivity instruments (see Figure 4 in GGS report), subsurface anomalies generally coincided with past service-station operations, such as previous pump islands, storage buildings, hydraulic hoists, and a "grease pit", as reflected in historical records provided in Appendix A.

<a id='f2f84c56-7378-4c10-86cc-eb981a20700c'></a>

No subsurface features that were consistent with the presence of USTs were identified in the screened areas. This finding, in conjunction with a prior grading-permit reference that pertained to "storage tank backfill", would be consistent with the prior removal of the site's former USTs.

<a id='d1f75f3f-e7fb-49c7-a08b-b03df0a677f6'></a>

3.2 Soil Sampling

As discussed below, soil-vapor sampling activities were completed to screen for petroleum and/or other chemical impacts at suspect areas of the property. As part of the vapor-probe installtion at two locations

(SV-6 and SV-7), which were located on a portion of the site that was reported to have at one time been used as junk yard, representative soil samples were collected from depths of roughly 1 foot below grade. These recent sample locations are depicted on Figure 3.

<a id='a616daf5-b5fa-40de-9b47-0e456144abd5'></a>

The samples were collected in driven, stainless-steel tubes, which were sealed and capped, and placed in an iced cooler, pending delivery to the laboratory. The samples subsequently were delivered to American Scientific Laboratories, LLC (ASL), located in Los Angeles, California, under chain of custody. Following a compositing of the two samples, the soils were analyzed by for Title 22 Metals, using EPA Method 6010B/7471A.

<a id='3d82206d-b66d-4d42-9df0-08f79424cc12'></a>

The analytical report indicated the presence of arsenic at a concentration of 1.68 parts per million (ppm). This concentration was slightly greater than a published Environmental Screening Level (ESL) for this compound in shallow soils at commercial properties. The remaining Title 22 metals were reported at concentrations that were well below the respective ESL values, or were not detected.

<a id='0644d7e5-0b79-41c7-93a2-50ff52eb7ab3'></a>

These recent soil-sample data are summarized in Table 1 - Soil-Sampling Title 22 Analytical Results.
Additionally, copies of ASL's analytical report and sample-custody form are included in Appendix C.

<a id='1a1d673a-2864-4fe5-9f59-45fe727f179c'></a>

## 3.3 Soil-Vapor Sampling

CEC's recent subsurface-screening activities culminated with the collection and analysis of soil-vapor samples. For these services, a specialty contractor was utilized for providing access holes in the flooring/pavement surfaces, and subsequent collection of representative soil-vapor samples from beneath the floor slab/pavement. Soil-vapor samples were collected at eight locations that were deemed most likely to exhibit chemical and/or petroleum impacts, if present, based on previously discussed rationale (see Figure 3).

<a id='67111d7e-82d1-47f7-a402-30bb82ca88cd'></a>

These additional services were provided by Optimal Technology (OT), operating out of Thousand Oaks, California. Upon collection, OT's personnel transferred the various soil-vapor samples directly into an on-site analytical instrument that was housed in a mobile laboratory. The soil-vapor samples were analyzed for the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by EPA Method 8021B. Following sample collection, the temporary vapor probes were removed and the boreholes were back-filled with inert material, and the floor/pavement surfaces were patched to match existing grade.

<a id='04b8495e-609f-49ef-95f5-fddfe07626cc'></a>

The soil-vapor analytical report indicated the presence of tetrachloroethene, also known as perchloroethene, or PCE, in each of the collected soil-vapor samples. The reported PCE values in soil vapors ranged from 3.69 to 22.42 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). Each of these values exceeds the recommended screening level for PCE in commercial-site soil vapors of 0.603 ppbv (California Human Health Screening Levels).

<a id='33dc6d98-a965-4323-8b69-109fb37f9207'></a>

The soil-vapor screening did not identify the presence of any of the most common VOCs that are associated with gasoline and other petroleum products (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and total xylenes). This finding is deemed to be consistent with a lack of fuel-related environmental impacts at the site.

<a id='30904be6-9bd0-4f5a-8654-2d5eab036f87'></a>

The recent soil-vapor data are summarized in Table 2 - Soil-Vapor Sampling Analytical Results.
Additionally, copies of OT's analytical report are included in Appendix D.

## 4.0 DISCUSSION OF ADDITIONAL-INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

No subsurface features that would be consistent with the presence of USTs were identified in the screened areas. This finding, in conjunction with a prior grading-permit reference for "storage tank backfill", is deemed to be consistent with the prior removal of the site's former USTs.

<a id='b11ae5ed-e462-4c17-b766-c1210f469001'></a>

The described soil-sample analytical report indicated the presence of arsenic at a concentration of 1.68 ppm. This concentration was slightly greater than the published ESL for this compound in shallow soils at commercial properties. The remaining Title 22 metals were reported at concentrations that were well below the respective ESL values, or were not detected.

<a id='c529596d-1dab-4782-bd60-b7c4f64d9524'></a>

The described soil-vapor analytical report indicated the presence of tetrachloroethene, also known as perchloroethene, or PCE, in each of the collected samples. The reported PCE values in soil vapor ranged from 3.69 to 22.42 ppbv. Each of these values exceeds the screening level for PCE in commercial-site soil vapors of 0.603 ppbv (California Human Health Screening Levels).

<a id='fd24b04c-02e1-48ab-bab3-e520c3225fb4'></a>

The soil-vapor screening did not identify the presence of any of the most common VOCs that are associated with gasoline and other petroleum products (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and total xylenes). This finding is deemed to be consistent with a lack of present-day, fuel-related environmental impacts at the site.

The address of the subject property is 2001-2005 Sacramento Street, 1024 Mateo Street, and 2016 Bay Street, Los Angeles, California (herein referred as subject property). The subject property is located in a commercial and industrial area in the City of Los Angeles, California. According to County of Los Angeles Assessor's Office, the assessor's parcel number (APN) of the subject property is 5166-011-021. All adjoining areas consist of commercial and industrial buildings.

<a id='ce999b57-cdf1-48c2-a63d-ed1552ccaea2'></a>

During the site reconnaissance, the subject property was observed to be occupied by MV Transportation Inc. MV Transportation, Inc. is engaged in the auto repair and service business for MTA buses. The subject property consists of a rectangular shaped parcel with a steel frame automotive repair and service building with associated offices in the northwestern portion and a steel frame storage shed in the southeastern portion of the property. The remaining portions of the site are utilized to park MTA busses. During the site reconnaissance, a drainage and a three compartment belowground clarifier were observed in the southeastern portion of the site. This area is utilized to wash vehicles. The wastewater generated from automotive washing operations is collected in the belowground clarifier and subsequently discharged into the city sewer. During the site reconnaissance, a large propane tank was observed in the middle of the property. Storm drainage is accomplished via drains located at the property which direct surface water to storm drains in the surrounding streets. No other significant structures and/or features were observed at the subject property.

<a id='75977118-3a02-4028-be67-f103bd79a874'></a>

During the site reconnaissance, significant quantities of hazardous materials/ hazardous wastes (i.e. brake fluids, motor oil, transmission oil, coolants, batteries, waste oil, waste anti-freeze, etc.). were observed in the automotive repair/service building and the storage shed. The hazardous materials/hazardous wastes were stored in 55-gallon and 250-gallon containers and placed in secondary containments. Significant stains were observed in the vicinity of hazardous materials/hazardous waste storage containers. The hazardous wastes generated at the site are picked up by Safety Kleen for proper disposal.

Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
2001-2005 Sacramento Street, 1024 Mateo Street and 2016 Bay Street
Los Angeles, CA 91402

<a id='65673e56-945e-4bbd-b252-8b038778b6ea'></a>

The subject property is bounded by Bay Street to the north, beyond which are Casita International, Zacatecas Imports, and other industrial developments, LAZ- Express and other industrial developments to the east, Selected Textiles, NSM, Intaglio Inc. and other industrial developments to the south, and Sacramento Street to the west beyond which are CDL Scrap Metals, Pegasus Inc., and other industrial developments.

<a id='55b339b2-c58e-47e7-8042-1f23c61c002b'></a>

A review of records available at the City of Los Angeles Department of Building and safety revealed that the subject property was previously occupied by a service station and Wash Rack with a clarifier and Grease Pit and a junk yard. The owner of the service station is indicated Standard Oil Company. A further review of records indicated that an application for grading permit for the storage tank backfill was filed on August 22, 1975. It is unknown whether the tank(s) were abandoned in-place by backfilling. It is unknown how many tanks were installed/removed and/or abandoned in-place associated with the former auto service station owned by Standard Oil Company.

<a id='52e6554e-03e2-43b6-ba1b-93a08a701fed'></a>

Review of government database report revealed that the subject property tenants, Consolidated Fibers and MV Transportation, are listed on the Hazardous Waste Information System (HWIS) database. The database report indicated that Consolidated Fibers and MV Transportation generated waste oil and unspecified organic liquid mixtures at the site. It should be noted that potential for environmental concern is not necessarily present simply because a property is listed on this database. HWIS does not track violators and the presence of a facility on the HWIS database does not necessarily indicate that an environmental concern exists at that facility. The presence of these facilities on the HWIS database is not, in itself, considered to represent an environmental concern.

<a id='f525c214-3c58-4488-92e8-9b8f5947051d'></a>

A further review of government regulatory databases revealed no off-site facilities of concern identified in the immediate vicinity that may have potentially impacted the subject site.

## 4.0 REGULATORY AGENCY RECORDS SEARCH

The purpose of Government database lists is to document the location of known Federal and State superfund sites or other known or potential hazardous waste sites within a one-eighth to one mile radius of the subject property. The review will also serve to indicate the possibility that the subject property may become a "border zone property@, defined as a property located within 2000 feet of a State-designated hazardous waste property.

<a id='6bcdf67a-e659-4c7e-a3d9-de42875f991b'></a>

EMA obtained a Government record report prepared by BBL of Solana Beach, California. This computer generated report is attached to this preliminary environmental site assessment report as Appendix B and consists of Government listed properties within a one-eighth to one-mile radius of the subject property which store and use hazardous materials or have had a release of hazardous materials to soil or groundwater. The study area for this preliminary environmental site assessment includes a one-eighth to one mile radius for Federal, State and local database sources to meet the ASTM standards.

<a id='0382e10f-c9d1-4845-826f-cfe67eae5e8d'></a>

Appendix B includes a complete copy of the regulatory agency database search report generated by BBL for select agency databases only. The accuracy of the results of the report in Appendix B is constrained by the limits of care and professional skill exercised by the EMA's sub-consultant. For completeness and quality control, additional agency records were investigated personally by EMA personnel.

<a id='b42c2f12-5559-4043-acc5-bcef28ab14e2'></a>

EMA makes no claims as to the completeness or accuracy of the referenced sources. BBL's review of these records can be only as current as their listings, and may not represent the entire sum of known or potential hazardous waste of contaminated sites.

<a id='5fc78189-d6c3-4188-9383-3193f90892aa'></a>

EMA reviewed the following agency lists to evaluate whether there are sites within the study area that may pose potential environmental concerns relative to the site.

4.2.10 Hazardous Waste Information System

<a id='ad04bd9d-9f76-4d74-97bf-1aeb620ee76b'></a>

The DTSC maintains a database keeping track of the movement and disposal of
hazardous waste. The data is used to support the Tanner legislation, AB 2948.

<a id='3be36798-2c4d-455a-b97e-7c0d6eaabe39'></a>

The subject property is listed on this database. In addition, two hundred and twenty-one additional sites are listed on this database. The subject property tenants, Consolidated Fibers and MV Transportation, are listed on this database. The database report indicated that Consolidated Fibers and MV Transportation generated waste oil and unspecified organic liquid mixtures at the site. It should be noted that potential for environmental concern is not necessarily present simply because a property is listed on this database. HWIS does not track violators and the presence of a facility on the HWIS database does not necessarily indicate that an environmental concern exists at that facility. The presence of these facilities on the HWIS database is not, in itself, considered to represent an environmental concern.

## 5.1 Geology and Hydrogeology

The geologic Map of California indicated that the geology of the area within the subject site consist of alluvial fill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Report and General Soil Map of Los Angeles County indicate that the soil in the area defined as Hanford association, 2 to 5 percent slopes. The Hanford soils are over 60 inches deep, are well drained, and have moderately rapid subsoil permeability. They have pale-brown coarse sandy loam surface layers about 8 inches thick underlain by light yellowish-brown coarse sandy loam and gravely loamy coarse sand substratum.

6.3 City Directories Records

City Directories have been published for many cities and towns across the United States since the 18th Century. Originally a list of town residents, the City Directory became a tool for locating individuals and businesses in a particular urban or suburban area. For each address within an area, City Directories list the name of each resident or, if a business operates from that address, the name and the type of business. This historic overview of occupants of a given property is a valuable tool for companies involved in assessing the historic prior use of any resident or commercial property.

<a id='e68e3b87-602d-4f09-b876-12bf9e4fe304'></a>

BBL performed the City Directories search. The following is the result of City Directory Search:

## 6.10 Data Failure

The objective of historical research is to develop a history of the previous uses of the subject property and surrounding area, in order to help identify the likelihood release of hazardous substances as a result of past activities. The agreed scope of work requires the assessor to attempt to identify use of the Property at 5-year intervals from 1940 to the present, or, if the Property was already developed in 1940, to the first date of development, but recognizes that data failure frequently occurs, making this impossible. When data failure occurs, ASTM

## 7.0 SITE RECONNAISSANCE

On June 25, 2015, EMA personnel conducted an inspection of the site located at 2001-2005 Sacramento Street, 1024 Mateo Street, and 2016 Bay Street, Los Angeles, California, to assess the current on-site activities that may pose potential impact to the subsurface conditions of the subject site.

<a id='f140675b-46cf-44db-93c3-7a078123ecfc'></a>

During the site visit, EMA personnel inspected the subject site regarding potential environmental concerns including the presence of the UST's or AST's, spray booths, pits, clarifiers, and/or sumps, quantities and types of hazardous/toxic materials and wastes stored, treated, used, generated, or disposed of as part of present or previous tenants business activities, unusual stains or odors, and knowledge of hazardous material spills on the subject site. The subject site was inspected for evidence of any staining and/or spills.

<a id='0b022db1-2800-4593-a402-cfbbb1f588f0'></a>

Environmental considerations associated with the site and the study area is discussed in the following sections.

<a id='174931c0-1ca7-4721-a070-13d292ba3254'></a>

7.1 Aboveground Storage Tanks

During the site reconnaissance, with the exception of a large propane tank, no other aboveground fuel storage tanks were observed on the subject property. No environmental concerns were noted in the vicinity of propane tank.

<a id='9a6d1684-571c-401a-860f-05ec52ac6c85'></a>

7.2 **Underground Storage Tanks**
During the site reconnaissance, manways, vent pipes, fill connections, concrete pads and saw cuts were not observed in the paved areas of the site.

<a id='5f326e99-3089-473e-9ca5-598f1e0ada02'></a>

7.3 **Water and Wastewater**

During the site reconnaissance, a drainage and a three compartment clarifier were observed in the southeastern section of the site. This area is utilized to wash vehicles. The wastewater generated from automotive washing operations is collected in the below ground clarifier and subsequently discharged into the city sewer via this clarifier.

<a id='188f197f-e630-4d11-b5ed-8483ff506484'></a>

## 7.4 Hazardous Materials/Wastes

During the site reconnaissance, significant quantities of hazardous materials/ hazardous wastes (i.e. brake fluids, motor oil, transmission oil, coolants, batteries, waste oil, waste anti-freeze, etc.) were observed in the automotive repair/service building and the storage shed. The hazardous materials/hazardous wastes were stored in 55-gallon and 250-gallon containers and placed in to secondary containments. Significant stains were observed in the vicinity of hazardous materials/hazardous waste storage containers. The hazardous wastes generated at the site are picked up by Safety Kleen for proper disposal.

7.6 **PCBs**

In general, all PCB-designated transformers were required to be replaced with non-PCB-designated transformers when PCBs were designated as a carcinogen by the EPA in 1977. Transformers are currently classified as PCB-containing if their cooling oils contain greater than 50 milligrams per liter (ppm) total PCBs.

7.7 **Solid Waste**

Solid waste on the subject property is collected in a 10-cubic yard dumpsters situated in the storage shed. The dumpsters were noted to contain miscellaneous cardboard at the time of the Property reconnaissance and no indication of potentially hazardous material disposal was noted during EMA's reconnaissance.

<a id='b2feff0a-505c-4206-84a5-9053d34319ba'></a>

## 7.8 Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs)

The potential for the presence of friable ACM was evaluated based on the age of the improvements, dates of renovation and other relevant information. Appendix G of the USEPA Guidance Document: *Managing Asbestos in Place - A Building Owner's Guide to Operations and Maintenance Programs for Asbestos-Containing Materials* (the Green Book) was used as a guide in identifying suspect materials and the definition of suspect ACM and presumed asbestos containing material is taken from 29 CRF Parts 1910, et al. Occupational Exposure to Asbestos; Final Rule. It should be noted that asbestos may still be utilized in some non-friable products, such as sheet vinyl flooring, vinyl floor tiles, floor tile mastic, joint compound, asbestos-cement board and roofing materials, as these materials may still be manufactured and installed in the United States. The level of the preliminary evaluation performed was not designed to comply with the survey requirements of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA), 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 763, National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) 40 CFR 61, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR Part 1926.1101, or other local, state or federal regulations, but has been conducted per accepted industry practices to satisfy the scope of work of the rating agencies and/or lenders. A finding in this report of "ACM is not a significant concern" or "No significant asbestos was identified" should not be interpreted as "the building is asbestos free".

Based on the original date of construction (prior to 1981) construction materials may contain asbestos and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101, requires certain construction materials to be presumed to contain asbestos, for purposes of this regulation. All thermal system insulation (TSI) and surfacing material that are present in a building constructed prior to 1982 and have not been appropriately tested are presumed asbestos containing material (PACM). No asbestos sampling was conducted as part of this assignment.

<a id='6b17fd44-cb83-4f5d-8d61-c1fa29da99b1'></a>

## 7.9 Pesticides

No visual evidence of pesticides use on the property was observed during the site reconnaissance. A review of the historical aerial photographs did not reveal the presence of any agricultural activities and/or nursery at the subject site.

<a id='423d3f32-f565-41e7-adfd-56a15c29aa67'></a>

7.10 **Radon**

High radon readings are typically found and tested in areas of geologic activity, and in cold-weather climates where structures have inadequate ventilation and below grade construction. Radon levels of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) or greater are considered significant readings.

<a id='90d86b04-ff79-4ea2-b429-438dab77dcdd'></a>

The US EPA has prepared a map to assist National, State, and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes. The map divides the country into three Radon Zones, Zone 1 being those areas with the average predicted indoor radon concentration in residential dwellings exceeding the EPA Action limit of 4.0 picoCuries per Liter (pCi/L). It is important to note that the EPA has found homes with elevated levels of radon in all three zones, and the EPA recommends site specific testing in order to determine radon levels at a specific location. However, the map does give a valuable indication of the propensity of radon gas accumulation in structures. Review of the EPA Map of Radon Zones places the Property in Zone 2, where average predicted radon levels are between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L.

## 9.0 FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### 9.1 Findings

A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: due to release to the environment; under conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. The following was identified during the course of this assessment:

*   EMA identified recognized environmental conditions in connection with the property during the course of this assessment. The recognized environmental conditions included drainage/belowground clarifier associated with auto washing operations at the site. In addition, significant stains were observed in the vicinity of hazardous materials/hazardous wastes storage areas at the site.

<a id='7146e800-d8c3-4ba9-95e8-15e094ec6a8b'></a>

A _controlled recognized environmental condition (CREC)_ refers to a REC resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, with hazardous substances or petroleum products allowed to remain in place subject to the implementation of required controls. The following was identified during the course of this assessment:

* EMA did not identify any controlled recognized environmental conditions during the course of this assessment.

<a id='2709d712-a5ef-4eb1-b321-1f05f3017a57'></a>

A historical recognized environmental condition (HREC) refers to a past release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the property and has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority or meeting unrestricted use criteria established by a regulatory authority, without subjecting the property to any required controls. The following was identified during the course of this assessment:

* EMA identified historical recognized environmental conditions during the course of this assessment. The recognized environmental conditions included operation of a service station, Wash Rack with a clarifier, grease pit and a junk yard at the site in the past. The owner of the service station was indicated Standard Oil Company. A further review of records indicated that an application for grading permit for the storage tank backfill was filed on August 22, 1975. It is unknown whether the tank(s) were abandoned in-place by backfilling. It is unknown how many tanks were installed/removed and/or abandoned in-place associated with the former auto service station owned by Standard Oil Company at the site.

Dear Mr. Johannes:
A geophysical survey was conducted on July 24th and 29th, 2015 at the above mentioned property. The purpose of the geophysical survey was to screen an approximate 180 by 150 ft area for underground storage tanks (USTs). Surface metallic objects that interfered with the geophysical investigation included fences, an above-ground storage tank, reinforced concrete, reinforced concrete mesh, parked vehicles, busses and other surface structures.

<a id='3437c813-f636-4535-9e04-2698eab58418'></a>

**METHODOLOGY**
The geophysical instruments used during this investigation included a Geometrics G-858 magnetometer (G-858), a Geonics EM-61Mk2A high frequency metal detector (EM-61), a Geonics EM-31 conductivity meter (EM-31) and a GSSI SIR-20 ground penetrating radar (GPR) with 400-MHz antenna.

<a id='ec52287b-a95c-42ea-a85a-0f6f9bd8a56e'></a>

Details on these geophysical methods can be found in the attached technical note titled
“Geophysical Techniques for Shallow Environmental Investigations.”

## FIELD PROCEDURES
Before conducting the geophysical survey, a 10- by 10-foot grid was marked on the ground within the survey area using surveyor paint. The survey area consisted of an asphalt lot with areas of reinforced concrete and reinforced concrete mesh. The grid was bound by a chain link fence to the south and west and buildings to the north and east. Obvious surface cultural features that could potentially affect the geophysical data (i.e. reinforced concrete, etc.) were identified in the field and plotted onto a scaled, hand-drawn site map. A site map showing the location of the geophysical survey area and surficial features is attached as Figure 1.

<a id='d799632a-c80b-4559-a3b3-d4396535fe3c'></a>

Measurements of the earth's total magnetic field intensity and vertical gradient were made with the G-858 at 0.2-second intervals as the operator walked along parallel approximately south to north (S-N) survey lines nominally spaced 5 feet apart. A marker was inserted in the data at 10 ft intervals. The 0.2-second sampling interval resulted in an average station spacing of about 0.5 feet. The magnetic data were stored in the internal memory of the magnetometer along with time of measurement. Magnetic data were downloaded to a laptop computer at the end of the magnetic survey.

<a id='b9ced837-d81a-4469-b100-22caac1df5d3'></a>

EM-61 measurements were made at 2.5 foot intervals along approximately south to north (S-N) survey lines spaced 5 feet apart using the 10-foot grid points for spatial control. The EM-61 data were stored in a digital data logger along with line and station number. EM-31 measurements were made at 5 foot intervals along approximately south to north (S-N) survey lines spaced 5 feet apart using the 10-foot grid points for spatial control. The EM-31 data were stored in a digital data logger along with line and station number. EM-61 and EM-31 data were downloaded to a laptop computer upon completion of the survey.

<a id='c0962e01-e360-427f-a088-1ec34fbd44a3'></a>

GPR data were acquired semi-continuously (12 scans per foot), as a cart mounted 400 MHz antenna was pushed along survey lines spaced approximately 5 ft apart along south to north (S-N) and west to east (W-E) survey lines. The GPR antenna was attached to a survey cart with an integrated survey wheel for spatial control. GPR data were viewed in real time on the SIR-20’s monitor and saved to the instrument’s hard disk. All field copies of GPR data are retained in the project files.

## DATA PROCESSING

### EM & Magnetic Data
Color-enhanced contour maps of the magnetic, EM-61 and EM-31 data were generated using the Oasis montaj® geophysical mapping system. Prior to contour map generation, a number of preprocessing steps were completed and included:

<a id='a3dec371-2e39-44a3-a8ca-2cb2ce210712'></a>

* Backup of all original field data files.
* Correcting of all data acquisition errors (typically only deleting the first portion of a reacquired line, renaming lines incorrectly labeled, deleting additional readings outside the grid, etc.).
* Reformatting field data files to free format XYZ files containing line number, station, time (if applicable) and field measurements.

• Applying small adjustments to EM-61 and/or EM-31 station locations to compensate for data being recorded while the operator was walking.
• Merging of multiple data files into a single file and sorting, if necessary.

<a id='0076f5d0-c44a-484c-82ba-9990e7ba28fa'></a>

The output of the data preprocessing was a data file containing line and station number and the geophysical measurements. These data files were imported into the Oasis montaj® mapping system and the following data processing steps applied:

*   Reformatting of data files to Oasis montaj® format.
*   Generating final map scale.
*   Gridding data using a 1- to 2.5-foot cell size.
*   Masking grid in areas where data were not acquired (i.e. around site perimeter).
*   Applying a Hanning filter to smooth the data, if necessary.
*   Generating color zone file describing color for different data ranges.
*   Contouring the data.
*   Generating map surrounds (title block, legend, scale, color bar, north arrow, etc.).
*   Annotating anomalies.
*   Merging various plot files and plotting final map.

<a id='33702b0a-957d-4d10-89d4-fd2bc5515bfe'></a>

**GPR Data**
GPR data were processed using the program GPR-Slice v7 by Geophysical
Archaeometry Laboratory, Inc. After the data were downloaded from the GPR unit, raw
data were imported into GPR-Slice. Processing included the following steps:

<a id='465965ca-2f02-4c8c-baed-b59badf4b5ae'></a>

* Create info file(s) that contain(s) spatial information for each traverse.
* Editing info file(s) to account for collection in reverse direction or varying geometry.
* Merging multiple info files into a primary info file, as necessary.
* Convert data into program compatible 16 bit format.
* Batch gain and remove data wobble.
* Create navigational notations for slicing using artificial or field markers.
* Apply filters such as Hilbert or boxcar, as necessary.
* Apply deconvolution and migration, as necessary.
* Slice/resample data using multiple time slices of chosen time thickness and overlap.
* Output time data into XYZ coordinates for gridding and presentation.

<a id='b4f0e099-5e47-4203-92d6-9951e795fac2'></a>

Color-enhanced contour maps of the GPR time slices were generated in the GPR-Slice program and output in jpeg format for review.

<a id='353b73e6-4d7b-4971-ab11-f7de210ea5d9'></a>

Additionally, to further characterize anomalies interpreted in the GPR time slice data, selected radargrams were converted to bmp format for review.

2, 3 and 4, respectively. Color-enhanced contour maps of the magnetic total field response, EM-61 Channel 3 response and the EM-31 in-phase response were also generated. However, these maps are not presented as they did not reveal additional information and were, therefore, considered redundant.
The coordinates shown in the contour maps (Figures 2, 3 and 4) reference the relative geophysical coordinate system shown in Figure 1. The color bar indicates the amplitude of the measured quantity with magenta and cyan indicating high and low amplitudes, respectively. Light orange, yellow and light green indicate average "background" values of the measured quantity.

A depth slice of the 3D GPR data at a depth of about 2 to 3 ft is presented as Figure 5 and selected GPR radargrams were output and are presented in Figure 6. Additional radargrams were generated, but are not presented as they did not reveal additional information and were, therefore, considered redundant. The distances shown on the radargrams reference the relative geophysical coordinate system.

Due to the presence of reinforced concrete over the majority of the site, the geophysical instruments that were of most use at this site were the magnetometer and the GPR. Especially in the case of the EM-61 and the EM-31 data, the reinforced concrete may mask the responses of any targets beneath the reinforcement. Even for the magnetometer and the GPR, the size of the target and the spacing of the reinforcement also have effects on the instruments' ability to see beneath the reinforced areas. Interpretation of anomalies is limited to sources that are large enough to be imaged through the reinforcement, or, in the case of GPR, in between the gaps in the rebar.

<a id='58dd4349-32ef-48bf-b2d1-b65890effc1d'></a>

Several anomalies caused by surface metallic objects are evident on the contour maps of the magnetic and EM data. These anomalies are labeled "SM" on the respective contour maps. These surface metallic objects correspond to buildings, posts, vehicles and other surface structures.

<a id='40a36adf-57ac-4443-9dcf-7e77610bd534'></a>

One small anomaly exists in the EM-61 and EM-31 data and is labeled B on Figures 3
and 4. This anomaly has a much smaller geophysical signature than expected for a UST.
The source of the anomaly is likely a small buried metallic object or debris, as it does not
appear in the Magnetometer data (Figure 2).

<a id='e2f17139-ba0f-4220-873d-ded54ff38301'></a>

One linear anomaly appears in the EM-31 data and is labeled P on Figure 4. The source of this anomaly is likely a buried pipe, pipe segment or other linear object.

<a id='6bac13a7-b9e3-41bd-afa5-fee6ad8f0aeb'></a>

There is one anomaly located outside the area of reinforced concrete, imaged in all data sets, labeled as A-1 in Figures 2 through 6. Anomaly A-1 has a similar response to the reinforced concrete areas in the EM-61 and EM-31 data (Figures 3 and 4). The magnetic vertical gradient response of anomaly A-1 (Figure 2), however, is more prominent than the areas of reinforced concrete, indicating the source of the anomaly is likely larger or contains more metal. However, the magnetic response is not indicative of a typical, cylindrical metallic UST.

In the 3D GPR data, anomaly A-1 appears from approximately 42 to 62 North and 10 to 50 East (Figure 5). This depth slice, at a depth of approximately 2-3 feet below ground surface, illustrates that the maximum reflectivity of anomaly A-1 occurs beneath most of the reinforced concrete areas visible in the EM data. Some reinforced concrete mesh is still visible in the GPR data and is labeled RC and several small buried objects are labeled as B on Figure 5.

<a id='ffa97c3a-d2cb-4be2-b92d-8f41508ae9a6'></a>

Selected radargrams presented in Figure 6 indicate the source of anomaly A-1 is a reinforced concrete area with several 2-3 foot gaps in the reinforcement. These gaps in the reinforcement occur where there are corresponding gaps in the EM anomalies (Figures 3 and 4). The presentation of this anomaly is not typical of a steel UST. This anomaly may be related to other infrastructure from the former service station or former pump islands. Several other features, likely caused by small buried pieces of debris, rubble or pipes are labeled as B/P on Figure 6.

<a id='3c6b18a6-25e8-4bf1-a773-419c6e1eae17'></a>

There are no other anomalies within the geophysical data that exhibit the typical response for a UST. However, it cannot be fully discounted that a UST may be present in the areas of surface metallic objects that could not be surveyed. Although the surface reinforced concrete pads mask EM-61 and EM-31 data, the magnetic data appears to indicate the large metallic objects, such as USTs, are not present beneath the concrete.

<a id='db0c9ab7-376c-4ab7-ae6c-730a5e2a04a6'></a>

The geophysical survey was designed to locate all buried metallic utilities and metallic objects the size of a 500-gallon tank or larger. It is our opinion that the geophysical survey was appropriately designed to locate all such objects less than about 8 feet deep; except in portions of the survey area where data was affected by subsurface utilities or surface structures, such as metallic debris, reinforced concrete mesh and other large surface metallic objects.

## MAGNETIC METHOD
The magnetic method generally involves the measurement of the earth's magnetic field intensity or vertical gradient of the earth's magnetic field. Anomalies in the earth's magnetic field are caused by induced or remanent magnetism. Induced magnetic anomalies are the result of secondary magnetization induced in a ferrous body by the earth's magnetic field. The shape and amplitude of an induced magnetic anomaly is a function of the orientation, geometry, size, depth, and magnetic susceptibility of the body as well as the intensity and inclination of the earth's magnetic field in the survey area. The magnetic method is an effective way to search for small metallic objects, such as buried ordnance and drums, because magnetic anomalies have spatial dimensions much larger than those of the objects themselves. Typically, a single buried drum can be detected to a depth of about 10 feet. Larger metallic objects can often be located to greater depths. Induced magnetic anomalies over buried objects such as drums, pipes, tanks, and buried metallic debris generally exhibit an asymmetrical, south up/north down signature (positive response south of the object and negative response to the north).

<a id='3274eef4-4564-4b92-94f2-c0d2e6d6b8d9'></a>

Magnetic data is typically acquired along a grid with results being
presented as color-enhanced contour maps generated by the
Geosoft™ Mapping System or OASIS montaj. The approximate
location and depth of magnetic objects can be calculated using the
Geosoft™ UXO System.

ELECTROMAGNETIC METHODS
Electromagnetic (EM) methods typically applied to shallow environmental investigations include frequency domain EM methods, such as EM induction and EM utility location methods, time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) metal detection methods, and ground penetrating radar (GPR) methods.

<a id='b2858f09-6d0f-4e90-a05e-623c7307bda1'></a>

**EM Induction Method**
EM induction surveys are often conducted using the Geonics
EM-31 terrain conductivity meter (EM-31). The EM-31 consists
of a transmitter coil mounted at one end and a receiver coil
mounted at the other end of a 3.7-meter long plastic boom.
Electrical conductivity and in-phase component field strength
are measured and stored along with line and station numbers in
a digital data logger. In-phase component measurements
generally only respond to buried metallic objects; whereas
conductivity measurements also respond to conductivity
variations caused by changes in soil type, moisture or salinity
and the presence of nonmetallic bulk wastes. The EM-31 must
pass over or immediately adjacent to a buried metallic object to
detect it. Typical EM-31 anomalies over small, buried metallic
objects consist of a negative response centered over the object
and a lower amplitude positive response to the sides of the
object. When the instrument boom is oriented parallel to long,

<a id='9e43a022-62fd-452c-8f8c-ea5cff47e931'></a>

linear conductors such as pipelines a strong positive response
is observed. The EM-31 can explore to depths of about 6
meters, but is most sensitive to materials about 1 meter below
ground surface. Single buried drums can typically be
detected to depths of about 5 feet.

<a id='7b277810-fa59-43df-8dc1-66e610e16029'></a>

EM-31 surveys are typically conducted to:
* Locate buried tanks and pipes
* Locate pits and trenches containing metallic and/or nonmetallic debris
* Delineate landfill boundaries
* Delineate oil production sumps and mud pits
* Map conductive soil and groundwater contamination
* Map soil salinity in agricultural areas
* Characterize shallow subsurface hydrogeology
  * Map buried channel deposits
  * Locate sand and gravel deposits
  * Locate conductive fault and fracture zones

**_EM Utility Location Methods_**
EM utility locators; such as the Metrotech 810, Metrotech 9890 and Radiodetection RD400, are designed to accurately trace metallic pipes and utility cables and clear drilling/excavation locations. These utility locators consist of a separate transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter emits a radio frequency EM field that induces secondary fields in nearby metallic pipes and cables. The receiver detects these fields and is used to accurately locate and trace the pipes, often to distances over 200 feet from the transmitter. Many of the utility locators have a passive 60Hz mode to locate live electrical lines. Modern utility locators are also capable of providing rough depth estimates of the pipes.

_**TDEM Metal Detection Methods**_

A Geonics EM-61 (EM-61) is a high sensitivity, time-domain, digital metal detector which is often used to detect both ferrous and non-ferrous metallic objects. It is designed specifically to locate buried metallic objects such as drums, tanks, pipes, UXO, and metallic debris and to be relatively insensitive to above ground structures such as fences, buildings, and vehicles.

<a id='896e0adc-7aa8-496e-a7f8-a8db2a5e351a'></a>

The EM-61 consists of two square, 1-meter coils, one mounted over the other and arranged on a hand-towed cart. The bottom coil acts as both a transmitter and receiver while the top coil is a receiver only. While transmitting the bottom coil generates a pulsed primary magnetic field, which induces eddy currents into nearby metallic objects. When the transmitter is in its off cycle both coils measure the decay of these eddy currents in millivolts (mV) with the results being stored in a digital data logger along with position information. The decay of the eddy currents is proportional to the size and depth of the metallic target. A symmetrical positive anomaly is recorded over metallic objects with the peak centered over the object.

<a id='d361324e-3e2d-43cf-8b1a-b93de347ba97'></a>

The signal from the top coil is amplified in such a way that both
coils record effectively the same response for a metallic object
on the surface and the top coil records a larger response for
buried metallic objects. The response of near surface objects
can, therefore, be suppressed by subtracting the lower coil
response from the upper coil response (differential response).

<a id='14539bff-ec26-44b9-846e-ad0c4c1e930a'></a>

In practice, the usable depth of investigation of the EM-61
depends on the size and shape of the object and the amount of
above ground interference encountered at the site. A single
buried drum can often be detected at a depth of about 10 feet.

A GPR system radiates short pulses of high-frequency EM energy into the ground from a transmitting antenna. This EM wave propagates into the ground at a velocity that is primarily a function of the relative dielectric permittivity of subsurface materials. When this wave encounters the interface of two materials having different dielectric properties, a portion of the energy is reflected back to the surface, where it is detected by a receiver antenna and transmitted to a control unit for processing and display.

Depth penetration is a function of antenna frequency and the electrical conductivity of the soils in the survey area. Lower frequency antennas achieve greater depth penetration than higher frequency antennas, but have poorer spatial resolution. Conductive soils, such as clays, attenuate the radar waves much more rapidly than resistive dry sand and rock. In many environments in California, depth penetration of 500 and 300 MHz antennas is limited to 3 to 5 feet. Depth penetration may be greater if shallow soils consist of clean sands and less if shallow soils consist of clay.

<::A Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey output displaying hyperbolic reflections indicative of underground objects. The horizontal axis is labeled "DISTANCE (feet)" ranging from 0 to 135 feet. The vertical axis is labeled "APPROXIMATE DEPTH (feet)" ranging from 0 to 10 feet. Several large hyperbolic reflections are identified by arrows and labeled "TANK" or "TANKS" at various distances and depths. Smaller, shallower hyperbolic reflections are also identified by arrows and labeled "PIPES". The background shows a colorful GPR profile with varying signal strengths.: image::>

Dear Mr. Johannes:

This letter presents the results of the soil vapor investigation conducted by Optimal Technology
(Optimal), for Certified Environmental Consultants on July 31, 2015. The study was performed
at 2016 Bay St., Los Angeles, California.

<a id='397c935a-94c8-4b20-a16c-738d2706aa1b'></a>

Optimal was contracted to perform a soil vapor survey at this site to screen for possible chlorinated solvents and aromatic hydrocarbons. The primary objective of this soil vapor investigation was to determine if soil vapor contamination is present in the subsurface soil.

<a id='0b6ae195-1627-464d-8fd1-76935d0faf9d'></a>

## Gas Sampling Method

Gas sampling was performed by hydraulically pushing soil gas probes to a depth of 5.0 feet below ground surface (bgs). An electric rotary hammer drill was used to drill a 1.0-inch diameter hole through the overlying surface to allow probe placement when required. The same electric hammer drill was used to push probes in areas of resistance during placement.

<a id='ea999a87-1102-447d-aeda-2ca3acc42c33'></a>

At each sampling location an electric vacuum pump set to draw 0.2 liters per minute (L/min) of soil vapor was attached to the probe and purged prior to sample collection. Vapor samples were obtained in Hamilton gas-tight syringes by puncturing tubing which connects the sampling probe and the vacuum pump. New tubing was used at each sampling point to prevent cross contamination. Samples were immediately injected into the gas chromatograph after collection.

<a id='a2061e57-1873-4066-84d0-4374de96c348'></a>

All analyses were performed on a laboratory grade Hewlett Packard model 5890 Series II gas chromatograph equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and an Electron Capture Detector (ECD). Restec wide bore capillary columns using hydrogen as the carrier gases were used to perform all analysis. All results were collected on a personal computer utilizing Hewlett Packard's PC based chromatographic data collection and handling system.

*5-Point Calibration*
The initial five point calibration consisted of 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 ul injections of the calibration standard. A calibration factor on each analyte was generated using a best fit line method using the HP data system. If the r factor generated from this line was not greater than 0.990, an additional five point calibration would have been performed. Method reporting limits were calculated to be 0.01-1.0 micrograms per Liter (ug/L) for the individual compounds.

<a id='36d020c7-a420-418e-9eb5-ae3d29fb3858'></a>

A daily calibration check and end of run calibration check was performed using a pre-mixed standard supplied by Scotty Analyzed Gases. The standard contained common halogenated solvents and aromatic hydrocarbons (see Table 1). The individual compound concentrations in the standards ranged between 0.025 nanograms per microliter (ng/ul) and 0.25 ng/ul.

*Sample Replicates*
A replicate analysis (duplicate) was run to evaluate the reproducibility of the sampling system and instrument. The difference between samples did not vary more than 20%.

<a id='0883c98a-95f7-4c30-be08-caa8a277c1c8'></a>

Equipment Blanks
Blanks were run at the beginning of each workday and after calibrations. The blanks were collected using an ambient air sample. These blanks checked the septum, syringe, GC column, GC detector and the ambient air. Contamination was not found in any of the blanks analyzed during this investigation. Blank results are given along with the sample results.

<a id='0952f6af-fcdb-4f0c-a74d-0d11742b25d5'></a>

Tracer Gas
A tracer gas was applied to the soil gas probes at each point of connection in which ambient air could enter the sampling system. These points include the top of the sampling probe where the tubing meets the probe connection and the surface bentonite seals. Isobutane was used as the tracer gas, found in common shaving cream. No Isobutane was found in any of the samples collected.

### Scope of Work
To achieve the objective of this investigation a total of 9 vapor samples were collected from 8 locations at the site. Sampling depths, vacuum readings, purge volume and sampling volumes are given on the analytical results page. All the collected vapor samples were analyzed on-site using Optimal's mobile laboratory.

<a id='496e76b3-4d00-4df3-afc0-4cf616c4b5c4'></a>

Subsurface Conditions
Subsurface soil conditions at this site were predominately silty-sand from ground surface to 5.0 feet below ground surface. These soil conditions offered sampling flows at 0" water vacuum. Depth to groundwater was unknown at the time of the investigation.

<a id='f8c51c09-8ab2-4b89-af3d-824727af75f9'></a>

## Results
During this vapor investigation all nine samples contained levels of Tetrachloroethene (PCE). PCE levels ranged from 3.69 ug/L at SV-1 to 22.42 ug/L at SV-3. None of the other compounds listed in Table 1 above were detected above the listed reporting limits. A complete table of analytical results is included with this report.
