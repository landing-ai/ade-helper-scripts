# Document Intelligence in Snowflake

This workflow demonstrates how to transform unstructured documents (e.g., FDA Safety and Effectiveness Summaries) into **AI-ready, governed assets inside Snowflake** using **LandingAI‚Äôs Agentic Document Extraction (ADE)** together with **Snowflake Cortex**.  

With this solution, you can:  
- Parse multimodal documents (text, figures, tables, footnotes) with **ADE**  
- Store parsed and structured outputs securely inside **Snowflake**  
- Query structured fields using **Cortex Analyst** (text-to-SQL)  
- Enable **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) via **Cortex Search**  
- Enrich insights with **third-party knowledge** (e.g., PubMed) via **Cortex Knowledge Extensions**  
- Build intelligent **Cortex Agents** that orchestrate across tools  
- Provide a chat-style interface for business users with **Snowflake Intelligence**  

## Workflow in Snowflake

Here‚Äôs how the workflow runs entirely inside Snowflake:  

1. **Load documents** ‚Äì Upload unstructured FDA documents into a Snowflake stage.  
2. **Apply ADE natively** ‚Äì Use the ADE Native Application directly in Snowflake, ensuring all parsing and extraction runs in your account.  
3. **Parse and extract in one call** ‚Äì ADE outputs structured fields, text chunks, visual grounding, and metadata.  
4. **Enable retrieval with Cortex Search** ‚Äì Parsed chunks are indexed in a Cortex Search service for performant RAG.  
5. **Store structured fields for analytics** ‚Äì Extracted fields are written into Snowflake tables and queried via **Cortex Analyst**.  
6. **Enrich with PubMed** ‚Äì Add biomedical context by integrating the PubMed Biomedical Research Corpus from the Marketplace as a Cortex Knowledge Extension.  
7. **Build an intelligent agent** ‚Äì A **Cortex Agent** orchestrates across Cortex Search, Cortex Analyst, and PubMed, reasoning through queries.  
8. **Empower business users** ‚Äì **Snowflake Intelligence** provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the agent.  
 

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
