Unless otherwise indicated, the values shown in this statement for such investments have been provided by the management, administrator or sponsor of each program or a third-party vendor without independent verification by Fidelity Brokerage Services (FBS) and represent their estimate of the value of the investor’s participation in the program, as of a date no greater than 18 months from the date of this statement. Therefore, the estimated values shown herein may not necessarily reflect actual market values or be realized upon liquidation. If an estimated value is not provided, valuation information is not available.\n\nAI Accrued Interest Presented for domestic fixed income securities and represents interest accumulated since the last coupon date, but not yet paid by the issuer or received by NFS. AI is calculated for the following securities: fixed rate bonds and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). There is no guarantee that AI will be paid by the issuer. AI for treasury and GNMA securities, however, is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.

EY is calculated by dividing the current EAI for a security position by its statement closing date market value. EY reflects only the income generated by an investment; it does not reflect changes in its price, which may fluctuate. For certain types of securities, EAI and EY could include the return of principal or capital gains which would render them overstated. EAI and EY are estimates provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. There is no guarantee that your investments will actually generate the EAI or EY presented. Actual income and yield might be lower or higher. EAI and EY should not be confused with a security’s 30-day Yield or 7-day Yield, if provided, as such yield quotations reflect the actual historical performance of a security.

There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.  \n*Please refer to the Help/Glossary section of Fidelity.com for additional information on these calculations.* <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.035,t=0.615,r=0.962,b=0.748), with ID 39d7133f-277f-4c5d-8cd9-0b14af3d3287 -->\n\n**Bond & CD Income** includes interest payments for fixed rate bonds and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).\n**Bond & CD Principal** includes maturing principal payments for CDs and the following bonds: fixed rate, floating rate, variable rate, discount,and zero coupon.\n**Stock Income** includes estimated dividend payments for common stock, ADR's, and REITs.\n**Mutual Fund Income** includes estimated dividend payments for Fidelity and non-Fidelity mutual funds. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.036,t=0.749,r=0.873,b=0.825), with ID 7d8209c1-0df6-4bf3-9316-f663b0447860 -->\n\n*The table above does not include cash flow from the following securities:* preferred stocks, international stocks, exchange trade products (ETF's & ETN's), UITs, variable rate bonds, and international bonds, but may be included in future enhancements. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.037,t=0.825,r=0.944,b=0.869), with ID 24b7ba7f-7cda-4f88-a6e3-ca5fd686938c -->\n\n18 of 28 <!-- marginalia, from page 7 (l=0.919,t=0.950,r=0.963,b=0.971), with ID 6e258891-a8d4-4279-a24e-a022b5785439 -->\n\n*** SAMPLE STATEMENT ***\nFor informational purposes only <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.346,t=0.022,r=0.652,b=0.095), with ID 3f01af32-5e15-4027-ae85-fe3f15d39767 -->\n\nlogo: Fidelity Investments\n\n• The image is a logo featuring the words \"Fidelity INVESTMENTS\" in bold green text.\n• To the left of the text is a circular gold emblem with a stylized white pyramid or \"A\" shape, radiating white lines outward like sun rays.\n• \"Fidelity\" is in large, italicized, dark green font; \"INVESTMENTS\" is in smaller, spaced-out green capital letters beneath \"Fidelity\".\n• The logo is on a white background.\n• The registered trademark symbol (®) appears to the right of \"Fidelity\".\n\nAnalysis :\n• The use of green and gold suggests themes of growth, wealth, and stability, aligning with the financial services industry.

The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed. These estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed rate domestic bond and CD income are calculated using the security's coupon rate. The estimates for domestic common stock and mutual fund income are calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD).

The life expectancy factor used is based on both your date of birth and the beneficiary information we have on file as of December 31st of the prior year. Please contact Fidelity if there is a change in your beneficiary information as this calculation will not be updated until the calendar year following the year in which you change your beneficiary designation. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.057,t=0.210,r=0.477,b=0.377), with ID 912fcee4-8e8c-42de-b4c3-968b1fc31c96 -->\n\nYear-to-Date distributions include any distributions taken after January 1st of the current year through midnight of the statement end date. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.058,t=0.386,r=0.471,b=0.429), with ID b3c7c21e-5124-4dbd-8d1a-437178ea2a48 -->\n\nIt is your responsibility to satisfy IRS minimum distribution requirements.

For all other securities, EAI is calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to be reliable, but no assurance can be made as to accuracy. This third party data may not be promptly updated to reflect various corporate actions (for example, when an issuer has missed a scheduled dividend payment, announced changes to a payment schedule, or declared a stock split) and, as a result, the EAI and EY may be over or understated. Interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, and may be affected by current and future economic, political and business conditions.  Please refer to the Help/Glossary on Fidelity.com for additional information regarding these calculations. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.058,t=0.519,r=0.480,b=0.750), with ID d4069f1c-2d88-4395-a490-b0059f357ce0 -->\n\n**EAI and EY are not provided for:** preferred stocks, exchange traded products (ETFs & ETNs), UITs, variable rate bonds, and international stocks & bonds, but may be included in the future.

Except for interest income earned on, or distributed by, tax-exempt securities, Fidelity reports dividends and capital gains held in taxable accounts as taxable income. A portion of income reported as tax-exempt income may be subject to alternative minimum taxes and/or state and local taxes. In Traditional IRAs, Rollover IRAs, SEP-IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs and Keoghs, earnings are reported as tax-deferred income. In Roth IRAs and HSAs, earnings are reported as tax-exempt income as they may be federally tax-exempt if certain conditions are met.\nCost Basis, Gain/Loss, and Holding Period Information NFS is required to report certain cost basis and holding period information to the IRS on Form 1099-B. Unless otherwise specified, NFS applies the average cost method for open-end mutual funds and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other securities. Cost basis is adjusted for wash sales on securities with the same CUSIP held in the same account (unless your account receives mark-to-market reporting). Your statement may not reflect all adjustments required for tax purposes. Customers should consult their tax advisors for further information.\nCost Fidelity provides purchase cost information for securities held in retirement and HSA accounts. Such information may be adjusted for certain transactions and does not reflect dividends or capital gains distributions or reinvestments. Fidelity reports transaction profit or loss information when securities are sold within a retirement or HSA account. Transaction profit or loss is calculated by subtracting purchase cost from sales proceeds <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.062,t=0.159,r=0.506,b=0.431), with ID e51b2626-695c-4ac5-8b1c-f18008989ba7 -->\n\nusing the FIFO method if shares were purchased at different times or prices.

Any oral communications regarding inaccuracies or discrepancies should be reconfirmed in writing to protect your rights, including those under the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA).\nMaterial Changes Please advise us of material changes in your investment objectives or financial situation related to your brokerage account(s).\nMutual Funds and Performance An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund. Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully. Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Visit Fidelity.com/performance for most recent month-end performance.\nSales Loads & Fees Each fund reserves the right to terminate or modify its exchange privilege in the future. In connection with access to, purchase of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual fund and other investment products (\"funds\") or platforms, some funds, or their investment affiliates, pay FBS or NFS sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus as well as program participation and maintenance fees. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of compensation as well as other remuneration received by FBS or NFS will be furnished to you upon written request. At the time you purchase shares of funds those shares will be assigned either a load, transaction fee (TF) or no transaction fee (NTF) status. When you subsequently sell those shares, any fees applicable to your transaction will be assessed based on the status assigned to the shares at the time of purchase. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.504,t=0.136,r=0.948,b=0.450), with ID 62868a59-08f3-4de9-99fa-2982afd9db82 -->\n\nAdditional Information About Your Brokerage Account, If Applicable\n\nCustomer Free Credit Balance You are entitled to free credit balances in your brokerage account, subject to open commitments in your cash accounts. Free credit balances are not segregated and may be used by us in accordance with federal securities law. There is no free credit balance in a retirement account or HSA.\nAssets Separate from Your Brokerage Account Only securities in the main portion of your brokerage account contribute to margin and maintenance requirements. Other assets, which may be reported on your account statement, include mutual funds that are distributed by FBS and Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc. and mutual fund only accounts held directly with the fund (Fidelity Mutual Fund Accounts) and not carried by NFS, not covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and do not count toward your margin and maintenance requirements. Assets held in brokerage accounts managed by Strategic Advisers, Inc. and accounts carried by NFS and covered by SIPC but do not contribute to your margin and maintenance requirements.\nShort Account Balances Securities sold short are held in a segregated short account. These securities are unavailable for margin purposes, and any increases or decreases from the previous week's value is transferred weekly to your margin account. Fidelity represents your short account balance as of the last value mark-to-market, not as of the statement end date.\nInformation About Your Option Transactions Each transaction confirmation previously delivered to you contains full information about commissions and other charges, and such information is available promptly upon request.

The Total Market Value represents prices obtained from various sources, may be impacted by the frequency with which such prices are reported and such prices are not guaranteed. Prices received from pricing vendors are generally based on current market quotes, but when such quotes are not available the pricing vendors use a variety of techniques to estimate value. These estimates, particularly for fixed income securities, may be based on certain minimum principal amounts (e.g. $1 million) and may not reflect all of the factors that affect the value of the security, including market risk. The prices provided are not firm bids or offers. Certain securities may reflect N/A or unavailable where the price for such security is generally not available from a pricing service. The Market Value of a security, including those priced at par value, may differ from its purchase price and may not closely reflect the value at which the security may be sold or purchased based on various market factors. The sale or redemption of any fixed income security prior to maturity may result in a loss. Prices for Certificates of Deposits (CDs) on your statement are generally estimates and are not based on actual market prices. The secondary market for CDs is generally illiquid. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior to making a financial decision or placing an order. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.062,t=0.452,r=0.505,b=0.916), with ID 0d897e62-d6d0-4204-8954-1b65d99f0bd3 -->\n\nExecuting Orders on the Floor of the NYSE The Floor broker may permit the specialist to trade on parity with the order for some or all of the executions associated with that floor order, where such permission would not be inconsistent with the broker’s best execution obligations.\nAgency Trades Individual securities trades placed for your Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios account are completed on an agency basis by FBS.\nSIPC Securities in accounts carried by NFS, a Fidelity Investments company, are protected in accordance with the SIPC up to $500,000 (including cash claims limited to $250,000).

EY is calculated by dividing the current EAI for a security position by its statement closing date market value. EY reflects only the income generated by an investment; it does not reflect changes in its price, which may fluctuate. For certain types of securities, EAI and EY could include the return of principal or capital gains which would render them overstated. EAI and EY are estimates provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. There is no guarantee that your investments will actually generate the EAI or EY presented. Actual income and yield might be lower or higher. EAI and EY should not be confused with a security’s 30-day Yield or 7-day Yield, if provided, as such yield quotations reflect the actual historical performance of a security.

The Total Market Value represents prices obtained from various sources, may be impacted by the frequency with which such prices are reported and such prices are not guaranteed. Prices received from pricing vendors are generally based on current market quotes, but when such quotes are not available the pricing vendors use a variety of techniques to estimate value. These estimates, particularly for fixed income securities, may be based on certain minimum principal amounts (e.g. $1 million) and may not reflect all of the factors that affect the value of the security, including market risk. The prices provided are not firm bids or offers. Certain securities may reflect N/A or unavailable where the price for such security is generally not available from a pricing service. The Market Value of a security, including those priced at par value, may differ from its purchase price and may not closely reflect the value at which the security may be sold or purchased based on various market factors. The sale or redemption of any fixed income security prior to maturity may result in a loss. Prices for Certificates of Deposits (CDs) on your statement are generally estimates and are not based on actual market prices. The secondary market for CDs is generally illiquid. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior to making a financial decision or placing an order.","grounding":[{"page":27,"box":{"l":0.06236936151981354,"t":0.4522257447242737,"r":0.5054024457931519,"b":0.9156853556632996},"image_path":"/Users/andreakropp/Documents/Demos/ADE Demos/ADE_Reports/webinar/groundings/Fidelity-Account-Statement-Full_20250716_095352/page_27/text_0d897e62-d6d0-4204-8954-1b65d99f0bd3_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"0d897e62-d6d0-4204-8954-1b65d99f0bd3"},{"text":"Executing Orders on the Floor of the NYSE The Floor broker may permit the specialist to trade on parity with the order for some or all of the executions associated with that floor order, where such permission would not be inconsistent with the broker’s best execution obligations.\nAgency Trades Individual securities trades placed for your Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios account are completed on an agency basis by FBS.\nSIPC Securities in accounts carried by NFS, a Fidelity Investments company, are protected in accordance with the SIPC up to $500,000 (including cash claims limited to $250,000).
