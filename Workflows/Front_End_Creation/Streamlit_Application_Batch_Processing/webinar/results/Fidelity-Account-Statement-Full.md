A Investments such as direct participation program securities (e.g., partnerships, limited liability companies, and real estate investment trusts which are not listed on any exchange), commodity pools, private equity, private debt and hedge funds are generally illiquid investments and their current values may be different from the purchase price. Unless otherwise indicated, the values shown in this statement for such investments have been provided by the management, administrator or sponsor of each program or a third-party vendor without independent verification by Fidelity Brokerage Services (FBS) and represent their estimate of the value of the investor’s participation in the program, as of a date no greater than 18 months from the date of this statement. Therefore, the estimated values shown herein may not necessarily reflect actual market values or be realized upon liquidation. If an estimated value is not provided, valuation information is not available.

AI Accrued Interest Presented for domestic fixed income securities and represents interest accumulated since the last coupon date, but not yet paid by the issuer or received by NFS. AI is calculated for the following securities: fixed rate bonds and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). There is no guarantee that AI will be paid by the issuer. AI for treasury and GNMA securities, however, is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. AI totals represent accruals for only those securities with listed AI in the Holdings section of this statement. Please refer to the Help/Glossary section of Fidelity.com for additional information.

B See Cost Basis Information and Endnotes for important information about the adjusted cost basis information provided.

C Cost basis information (or proceeds from short sales) has been provided by you and has not been adjusted except as otherwise indicated. When positions are transferred between accounts, in certain cases, cost basis information may be automatically transferred and deemed to be customer-provided.

E Includes exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and other exchange-traded vehicles <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.035,t=0.227,r=0.488,b=0.629), with ID 811c70b7-43cb-4aec-bb2f-36f674c26fd2 -->

EAI & EY	Estimated Annual Income (EAI) & Estimated Yield (EY) EAI is an estimate of annual income for a specific security position over the next rolling 12 months. EY is calculated by dividing the current EAI for a security position by its statement closing date market value. EY reflects only the income generated by an investment; it does not reflect changes in its price, which may fluctuate. For certain types of securities, EAI and EY could include the return of principal or capital gains which would render them overstated. EAI and EY are estimates provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. There is no guarantee that your investments will actually generate the EAI or EY presented. Actual income and yield might be lower or higher. EAI and EY should not be confused with a security’s 30-day Yield or 7-day Yield, if provided, as such yield quotations reflect the actual historical performance of a security. For additional information, including calculation details, refer to the "Additional Information and Endnotes" section at the end of your statement.
h	The stated Interest Rate is the interest rate effective for Cash Balances in your FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep on the last day of the statement period.
M	Position held in margin account. All other positions held in cash account.
q	Customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at the Program Bank to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance. Subject to the terms of the customer agreement, customers are reminded that funds are swept to a Program Bank on the business day following the date that funds are credited to your account and until swept to a Program Bank, funds are covered by SIPC. For additional information, please see the FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep Disclosures on Fidelity.com.

The table above presents the estimated monthly interest and dividend income and return of principal that your current holdings may generate over the next rolling 12 months. The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed. These estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed rate domestic bond and CD income are calculated using the security's coupon rate. The estimates for domestic common stock and mutual fund income are calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to be reliable, but no assurance can be made as to accuracy. There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.

► Because you may own one or more products or account positions in your Fidelity account that are  eligible for FDIC insurance coverage, we want to remind you about current FDIC coverage  limits and why you should monitor your balances. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.055,t=0.217,r=0.473,b=0.294), with ID 4859032e-f6fe-4704-b132-4dbe9226cb42 -->

Generally, deposits at a bank held in nonretirement and qualified retirement accounts such as traditional or Roth IRAs are eligible for up to $250,000 coverage per account owner, per depository institution. Certain holdings at Fidelity are eligible for "passthrough" FDIC insurance coverage subject to these same limits. Eligible positions include: 1) Certificates of deposit (CDs) - Brokered CDs that are issued by an FDIC insured institution, 2) Core balances in the Fidelity(R) Cash Management Account, eligible Fidelity IRAs or Fidelity Health Savings Accounts(1), and 3) Any 529 Bank Deposit Portfolio investments. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.080,t=0.304,r=0.478,b=0.467), with ID 67904536-a667-48f1-af1a-4f4512e184f6 -->

You are responsible for monitoring your FDIC coverage. Generally, all the assets you hold at a depository institution are counted toward the FDIC coverage limit. Therefore, when considering whether your holdings will be FDIC insured, you must take into consideration both the combined balance of all bank deposits (including bank CDs) made directly through a particular institution as well as those deposits coming about indirectly through Fidelity or another brokerage firm. For more information about FDIC insurance coverage, please visit the FDIC Web site at www.FDIC.gov. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.081,t=0.477,r=0.479,b=0.623), with ID b16256ff-b892-496d-97b4-82595a2c029b -->

* Cash Balances in an account with the FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep Program are swept to an FDIC-insured account at a Program Bank. Funds are swept to the Program Bank on the business day following the date that funds are credited to your account and, until swept to the Program Bank, funds are covered by SIPC. Once at the Program Bank, the deposit is not covered by SIPC; however, the deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance coverage subject to the applicable coverage limits. All assets of the account holder at the Program Bank will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit. For additional information, please see the FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep Program Disclosure document that can be found at http:personal.fidelity.comaccountspdfRollover_Sep_Supplemental.pdf <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.080,t=0.633,r=0.476,b=0.832), with ID ec87b329-b72e-44de-9fb6-c0b51d29401d -->

Cost basis and gain/loss information is provided as a service to our customer, and is based on standards for filing US Federal Tax Returns as determined by Fidelity.

Amortization, accretion and similar adjustments to cost basis are provided for many fixed income securities (and some bond-like equities), however they are not provided for certain fixed income securities, such as short-term instruments, Unit Investment Trusts, foreign fixed income securities, or those that are subject to early prepayment of principal (pay downs). <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.501,t=0.304,r=0.920,b=0.396), with ID 4414ab77-09e2-485c-96cf-0f0da54f3829 -->

B Adjusted cost basis information is shown where this indicator is displayed. Adjusted cost basis reflects any cumulative original issue discount, premium, or acquisition premium (including any year-to-date amount). It assumes such amounts were amortized or accrued for tax purposes from the acquisition date through the disposition date. Premium amortization was calculated using the yield-to-maturity method. Acquisition premium was calculated using the ratable accrual method. Any market discount accretion for this position was calculated using the straight-line method and, if applicable, recognized upon disposition. Gain/loss displayed for this transaction is calculated using the cost basis adjustments, as described above. The adjusted cost basis used here may not reflect all adjustments necessary for tax purposes (such as wash sale adjustments) and may not apply if you are using an alternative amortization calculation method. Refer to IRS Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses, for additional information. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.502,t=0.401,r=0.921,b=0.649), with ID 2447e6ce-b78b-4e46-8a76-3d1ed6d873ff -->

If total cost basis information is provided for multiple tax lots, that total cost basis information (and any associated gain/loss displayed) may have been calculated using a combination of adjusted cost basis information (as described above) and non-adjusted cost basis information. Total cost basis information (and any associated gain/loss displayed) is calculated using adjusted cost basis for lots for which adjusted cost basis is provided and non-adjusted cost basis for lots for which adjusted cost basis is not provided or not applicable. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.500,t=0.654,r=0.917,b=0.784), with ID 352b516e-c39a-4abd-87f5-00e38e1ade38 -->

About Your MRD Estimate:

Each year your annual MRD estimate is calculated on or after January 1 using your prior year-end account balance divided by the applicable life expectancy factor.  The life expectancy factor used is based on both your date of birth and the beneficiary information we have on file as of December 31st of the prior year. Please contact Fidelity if there is a change in your beneficiary information as this calculation will not be updated until the calendar year following the year in which you change your beneficiary designation. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.057,t=0.210,r=0.477,b=0.377), with ID 912fcee4-8e8c-42de-b4c3-968b1fc31c96 -->

EAI for fixed rate domestic bonds and CDs is calculated using the coupon rate. For all other securities, EAI is calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to be reliable, but no assurance can be made as to accuracy. This third party data may not be promptly updated to reflect various corporate actions (for example, when an issuer has missed a scheduled dividend payment, announced changes to a payment schedule, or declared a stock split) and, as a result, the EAI and EY may be over or understated. Interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, and may be affected by current and future economic, political and business conditions.  Please refer to the Help/Glossary on Fidelity.com for additional information regarding these calculations. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.058,t=0.519,r=0.480,b=0.750), with ID d4069f1c-2d88-4395-a490-b0059f357ce0 -->

Income Summary Shows income by tax status for the statement and year-to-date periods. Except for interest income earned on, or distributed by, tax-exempt securities, Fidelity reports dividends and capital gains held in taxable accounts as taxable income. A portion of income reported as tax-exempt income may be subject to alternative minimum taxes and/or state and local taxes. In Traditional IRAs, Rollover IRAs, SEP-IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs and Keoghs, earnings are reported as tax-deferred income. In Roth IRAs and HSAs, earnings are reported as tax-exempt income as they may be federally tax-exempt if certain conditions are met.
Cost Basis, Gain/Loss, and Holding Period Information NFS is required to report certain cost basis and holding period information to the IRS on Form 1099-B. Unless otherwise specified, NFS applies the average cost method for open-end mutual funds and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for all other securities. Cost basis is adjusted for wash sales on securities with the same CUSIP held in the same account (unless your account receives mark-to-market reporting). Your statement may not reflect all adjustments required for tax purposes. Customers should consult their tax advisors for further information.
Cost Fidelity provides purchase cost information for securities held in retirement and HSA accounts. Such information may be adjusted for certain transactions and does not reflect dividends or capital gains distributions or reinvestments. Fidelity reports transaction profit or loss information when securities are sold within a retirement or HSA account. Transaction profit or loss is calculated by subtracting purchase cost from sales proceeds <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.062,t=0.159,r=0.506,b=0.431), with ID e51b2626-695c-4ac5-8b1c-f18008989ba7 -->

Material Changes Please advise us of material changes in your investment objectives or financial situation related to your brokerage account(s).
Mutual Funds and Performance An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund. Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully. Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Visit Fidelity.com/performance for most recent month-end performance.
Sales Loads & Fees Each fund reserves the right to terminate or modify its exchange privilege in the future. In connection with access to, purchase of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual fund and other investment products ("funds") or platforms, some funds, or their investment affiliates, pay FBS or NFS sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus as well as program participation and maintenance fees. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of compensation as well as other remuneration received by FBS or NFS will be furnished to you upon written request. At the time you purchase shares of funds those shares will be assigned either a load, transaction fee (TF) or no transaction fee (NTF) status. When you subsequently sell those shares, any fees applicable to your transaction will be assessed based on the status assigned to the shares at the time of purchase. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.504,t=0.136,r=0.948,b=0.450), with ID 62868a59-08f3-4de9-99fa-2982afd9db82 -->

Additional Information About Your Brokerage Account, If Applicable

Free credit balances are not segregated and may be used by us in accordance with federal securities law. There is no free credit balance in a retirement account or HSA.
Assets Separate from Your Brokerage Account Only securities in the main portion of your brokerage account contribute to margin and maintenance requirements. Other assets, which may be reported on your account statement, include mutual funds that are distributed by FBS and Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc. and mutual fund only accounts held directly with the fund (Fidelity Mutual Fund Accounts) and not carried by NFS, not covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and do not count toward your margin and maintenance requirements. Assets held in brokerage accounts managed by Strategic Advisers, Inc. and accounts carried by NFS and covered by SIPC but do not contribute to your margin and maintenance requirements.
Short Account Balances Securities sold short are held in a segregated short account. These securities are unavailable for margin purposes, and any increases or decreases from the previous week's value is transferred weekly to your margin account. Fidelity represents your short account balance as of the last value mark-to-market, not as of the statement end date.

Price Information/Total Market Value The Total Market Value has been calculated out to 9 decimal places; however, the individual unit price is displayed 5 decimal places. The Total Market Value represents prices obtained from various sources, may be impacted by the frequency with which such prices are reported and such prices are not guaranteed. Prices received from pricing vendors are generally based on current market quotes, but when such quotes are not available the pricing vendors use a variety of techniques to estimate value. These estimates, particularly for fixed income securities, may be based on certain minimum principal amounts (e.g. $1 million) and may not reflect all of the factors that affect the value of the security, including market risk. The prices provided are not firm bids or offers. Certain securities may reflect N/A or unavailable where the price for such security is generally not available from a pricing service. The Market Value of a security, including those priced at par value, may differ from its purchase price and may not closely reflect the value at which the security may be sold or purchased based on various market factors. The sale or redemption of any fixed income security prior to maturity may result in a loss. Prices for Certificates of Deposits (CDs) on your statement are generally estimates and are not based on actual market prices. The secondary market for CDs is generally illiquid. You should always request a current valuation for your securities prior to making a financial decision or placing an order. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.062,t=0.452,r=0.505,b=0.916), with ID 0d897e62-d6d0-4204-8954-1b65d99f0bd3 -->
