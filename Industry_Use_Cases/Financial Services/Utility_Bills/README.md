# Fast, Accurate Parsing of Utility Bills with LandingAI

This folder contains assets and scripts demonstrating **Agentic Document Extraction (ADE)** on **Utility Bills**. Utility bills are a common proof-of-address document in KYC and onboarding workflows.

Use this workflow to:

- Process PDFs or images of utility bills from many providers.
- Define custom field to extract using a JSON schema.
- Run Agentic Document Extraction on a batch of utility bills and save the results.
- Save the extracted results and visual grounding chunks as structured data.
