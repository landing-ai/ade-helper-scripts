Series 1 (orange bars, \"Average daily usage\"):\n    – Jun 2019: ~5 kWh\n    – Jul: ~13 kWh\n    – Aug: ~18 kWh\n    – Sep: ~10 kWh\n    – Oct: ~6 kWh\n    – Nov: ~6 kWh\n    – Dec: ~7 kWh\n    – Jan

peaking in summer, lowest in winter.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • There is a clear correlation between higher temperatures and increased electric usage, likely due to air conditioning in summer.\n  • Electric usage is lowest during cooler months (Oct–Apr), when temperature is also lowest.\n  • The total electric charges for the period shown is $46.42, suggesting the usage pattern directly impacts
