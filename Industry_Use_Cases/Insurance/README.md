# Agentic Document Extraction in Insurance

Leverage **Agentic Document Extraction** (ADE) to transform unstructured, high‑volume insurance paperwork into structured, actionable data–no templates needed.

ADE accurately extracts data from charts, tables, and complex visual layouts across type-written, hand-written, scanned and photographed documents. ADE provides visual grounding so that every extract field is linked back to its source to ensure traceability and trust.

LandingAI is HIPAA compliant, ensuring that we have the necessary administrative, physical, and technical safeguards in place to protect sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI) for our customers in the healthcare insurance industry.
