# Agentic Document Extraction in Corporate HR

Human Resources teams manage a wide variety of employee-related documents—from onboarding forms to performance reviews, resumes, and regulatory filings. **Agentic Document Extraction (ADE)** helps HR teams streamline these workflows by turning unstructured PDFs and scans into clean, structured, and validated data—without the need for templates.

## Core Benefits of ADE in Corporate HR Workflows

- **Streamline Employee Onboarding**  
  ADE automatically extracts critical information from onboarding documents like I‑9s, W‑4s, and background checks—reducing manual data entry, speeding up the hiring process, and improving compliance.

- **Accelerate Talent Acquisition**  
  By parsing resumes and applications for skills, education, and experience, ADE enables faster candidate screening and seamless population of applicant tracking systems (ATS).

- **Support Compliance & Employee Development**  
  ADE makes it easy to track continuing education requirements by extracting key training data (e.g. course names, CEU hours, license renewal dates), supporting both regulatory compliance and career development initiatives.

- **Enable AI-Powered Employee Self-Service**  
  When paired with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, ADE transforms policy documents into structured, retrievable knowledge—fueling chatbots that provide instant, consistent, and trustworthy answers to HR questions around benefits, leave, policies, and more.
